<h3>DEFINITION: an investor who believes that a particular stock or market is going to drop in price.</h3>
<p>
To remember that a bear is expecting prices to drop, visualize a bear swiping down with his paw on prey.</p>
<p>
Bears attempt to profit from a decline in prices. Bears are generally pessimistic about the state of a given market.</p>
<p>
For example, if an investor is bearish on Google stock, they will use a strategy to attempt to profit from the stock&#39;s decline.</p>
<p>
A bear is the opposite of a bull, who believes that a stock, sector, or market is going to rise in price.</p>
<p>
Using stocks, the only way a bear can profit is with short positions. Using options, there are many strategies, both long and short, that a bear can use to profit.</p>
