                            <h3>DEFINITION: an investment in debt, comparable to providing a loan to a business or governmental entity. When you purchase bonds, you are purchasing debt and will receive a return on your purchase, similar to interest.</h3>
                            <p>
                            Commercial and governmental entities sell bonds to generate cash and fund projects.</p>
                            <p>
                            Bonds are a fixed-income security, meaning they have a set rate of return for the purchaser, unless the entity defaults on the debt, in which case the purchaser of the bond loses their money.</p>
                            <p>
                            The interest rate paid to the purchaser of the bond is called a "coupon," and is paid in full on the bond&#39;s maturity date. Most bonds are issued in six months increments.</p>
