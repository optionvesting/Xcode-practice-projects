Many analysts use stock charts to determine whether a stock will increase or decrease in value. Charts are readily available on the web for free from sites like Google Finance or Yahoo! Finance, or on your online brokerage website. Each site presents the charts in a slightly different manner, so it&#39;s really a matter of personal preference.<br />

<br />

When analyzing a chart, look for resistance and support lines.<br />

<br />

➫ Support is like a floor that the price of the stock doesn&#39;t seem to drop beneath. If the price falls before the support, then more decreases in price may follow.<br />

➫ Resistance is like a ceiling that the stock price just can&#39;t get above. If the price ever breaks above the ceiling, that is called a breakout and often signals more gains to come.<br />

<br />

It is very common for stocks to have clear support and resistance levels, and for the price to constantly fluctuate between the floor and ceiling. The chart below is a classic representation of support and resistance. The red line was a support for the stock, and then it became the resistance. The green line depicts the new support price.

<p>

These support and resistance levels are completely horizontal, but that is not always the case. It is also common to see stocks with angled support and resistance levels that show bullish or bearish trends.</p>

<h1>Some basic lines to understand.</h1></p>

Other basic methods of chart analysis include stochastics and moving averages.<br />

<br />

Stochastic shows a line on a graph that depicts whether a stock is overbought or oversold. It is common for stocks to be overbought or oversold based on the madness of the market and overreactions of investors.<br />

<br />

➫ When you see a stock is overbought, you can expect a drop in price.<br />

➫ On the other hand, oversold indicators dictate a possible rise in value in the near future.<br />

<br />

Moving averages are used to visuallize the momentum (bullish or bearish) of a stock by drawing a line on a graph of the average price of a stock over a given period. The 15 day moving average (15-MA) shows the average price over the last 15 days for example.<br />

<br />

➫ If that line is moving up, the stock has bullish momentum.<br />

➫ A downsloping line shows bearish momentum.<br />

<br />

Take a look at Aug. 15th, 2012, on the chart of Wal-Mart stock below: the big chart shows the stock price over the last 3 months. The red line shows the 15-MA, the green line shows the 50-MA, and the small graph below is the stochastic.

➫ On Aug 15th, you can see that the 15-MA was well above the 50-MA, and both were bullish up to that point.<br />

➫ The stochastic (hovering around 80% for a while) shows that the stock was slightly overbought.<br />

➫ Since the stock was slightly overbought, the stock price started to drop and correct back towards the 50-MA.<br />

➫ The 50-MA continued bullish while the 15-MA was bearish for a couple of weeks as the stochastic also fell.</td>

<h1>The roller coaster ride.</h1></p>

Stock charts tend to look like a roller coaster (except they can&#39;t do loops) going up and down and up and down.<br />

<br />

➫ Some stocks are like a flat boring roller coaster, and we call them less volatile.<br />

➫ Other stocks go for one crazy ride after another, and are more volatile.<br />

<br />

The way to tell how volatile a stock is (compared with the rest of the market) is by looking at a statistic called the &quot;beta.&quot;<br />

<br />

➫ If the beta of a stock is &lt; 1, it&#39;s less volatile.<br />

➫ If the beta is &gt; 1, it&#39;s a more volatile stock and the price changes more drastically.<br />

<br />

So a stock with a beta of 1.2 is 20% more volatile than the market as a whole. Just search for a stock by its ticker on Yahoo! or Google finance and you&#39;ll find the beta.<br />

<br />

Both volatile and non-volatile stocks are important vehicles for profit, when using the correct strategies.</td>
