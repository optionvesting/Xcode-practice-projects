                            <h3>	DEFINITION: the amount of the price of an option that is related to how much time remains until the expiration of the option contract. Intrinsic value is the real value of an option. The time value represents the possibility that the option could gain more intrinsic value prior to expiring.</h3>
                                <p>
                                Options that are far in-the-money have very little time value. Options that are far out-of-the-money also have very little time value. Options that are near-the-money have the most time value.</p>
                                <p>
                                Time value decays as expiration approaches. This principle is called time value decay, and is a powerful idea in option trading.</p>
                                <p>
                                If you buy options, time value decay works against your long position. If you sell options, time value decay works in favor of your short position.</p>
                                <p>
                                To calculate time value, subract intrinsic value from the price of the option.</p>
