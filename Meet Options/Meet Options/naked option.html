                            <h3>DEFINITION: a single option position where the investor doesn&#39;t own the underlying stock, nor does the investor own another protecting option on the same underlying stock.</h3>

                            Naked option positions provide more reward than covered positions, but are also more risky.</p>
                            <p>
                            An example of a naked option is simply buying or selling a call or put option. The value of a naked option can fluxuate rapidly.</p>
                            <p>
                            An example of a covered option is selling covered calls. First buy 100 shares of a stock, and then sell 1 contract of an out-of-the-money call on the same stock. Since you already own the stock, your position has very limited risk.</p>
                            <p>
                            Another way to cover an option position is by adding a second "leg" to the position. For example, sell an out-of-the-money put, and then buy another put further out-of-the-money. You still bring in some profit since the put you sold cost more than the put you bought, but your risk is limited.</p>
