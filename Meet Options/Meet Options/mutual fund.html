                            <h3>DEFINITION: a portfolio (group) of stocks and bonds that is professionally managed. The money used to purchase the stocks and bonds comes from a pool of money from many Individual investors.

                                By purchasing a single mutual fund, an individual investor invests in many different diversified assets. Many individual investors purchase mutual funds so they don&#39;t have to manage their own investments, they just let the professional manage the fund.</p>
                                <p dir="ltr">
                                One main advantage of mutual funds is that since they are diversified, they are less risky than individual stocks.</p>
                                <p dir="ltr">
                                One disadvantage of mutual funds is that the professionals that manage the fund charge fees. Also, mutual funds don&#39;t guarantee profits so individual investors can still lose money.</p>                    </td>
