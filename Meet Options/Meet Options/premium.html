                            <h3>	DEFINITION: another name for the price of an option.  The premium is the sum of intrinsic value and time value.</h3>
                                <p>
                                If you buy an option, the amount of money you spend is called the premium. Similarly if you sell an option, the amount of cash you bring in at the time of the sale is called the premium.</p>
                                <p>
                                When selling options to open a short position, it is important to know how much of the premium is time value, since that value is essentially the secret to options trading.</p>
                                <p>
                                By knowing the premium (i.e. the price) of the option you can calculate the time value. If the option is out-of-the-money, then you know intrinsic value is 0, so the time value is equal to the premium. If the option is in-the-money, then use the following formulas to calculate time value.</p>
                                <p>
                                For a call:</p>
                                <p>
                                Time Value = Premium - (Stock Price - Strike Price)</p>
                                <p>
                                For a put:</p>
                                <p>
                                Time Value = Premium - (Strike Price - Stock Price)</p>
                                <p>
                                When the premium is made up of mostly intrinsic value, the option will have a higher delta and the price of the option will change more rapidly.</p>
                                <p>
                                When the premium is made up of mostly time value, the option will have a lower delta and the price of the option will change more slowly.</p>
