                            <h3>DEFINITION: a contract that controls the purchase or sale of ONLY 10 shares of a given stock. The contract offers the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call) or sell (put) 10 shares of the underlying stock, anytime prior to the option&#39;s expiration date.</h3>

                                Mini Options were created in early 2013, and are only available on very large cap stocks like Google and Apple. Mini Options work just like traditional options, except that they only control 10 shares of stock.</p>
                                <p>
                                Mini Options allow more investors with less money in their trading account to take advantage of the trading power of options.</p>
                                <p>
                                Due to their lower volume, Mini Options have a larger bid-ask spread than traditional options. Be sure to ask your broker how to place Mini Option orders if you plan to trade them. Due to the novelty of Mini Options, some brokerage websites still don&#39;t provide a simple and intuitive interface for Mini Option trading.</p>
