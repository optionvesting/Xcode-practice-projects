                                DEFINITION: when the person that sold an option is forced to sell (for a short call) or buy (for a short put) the underlying stock; the result of an option being exercised by the person that bought the option.</h3>
                            <p>
                            Most contracts will typically be exercised only if they expire in-the-money. However, any option can be exercised at any time prior to expiration.</p>
                            <p>
                            If you bought the option, you own the long position of the option, and you can decide when/if to exercise the option. If you exercise the option, the market maker gets assigned the option and must adhere to the contract.</p>
                            <p>
                            If you sell an option to open, you own the short position of the option, and you don&#39;t control when/if the option is exercised. You could get assigned the option at anytime, although it is unlikely to happen prior to expiration.</p>
