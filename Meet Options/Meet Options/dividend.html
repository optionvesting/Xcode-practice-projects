                                Dividends are measured in both dollar amounts and as a percentage of the price of the stock.</p>
                                <p>
                                Dividends are issued per share, and may be in the form of cash, stock or property. Older, well-established companies typically offer the highest dividends.</p>

                                Emerging and growing companies usually offer small dividends, if any, in order to reinvest their earnings to ensure future profit.</p>
