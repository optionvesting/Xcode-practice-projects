                            <h3>	DEFINITION: a type of order that allows you, the trader, to set the price instead of the market maker. When he receives the limit order, the market maker decides whether or not he wants to fill the order.</h3>
                                <p>
                                Limit orders are recommended when the stock or option you are buying has a large bid-ask spread. Limit orders can also be used to set your exit strategy to close your position.</p>
                                <p>
                                The downside to using a limit order is that the market maker doesn&#39;t have to fill it.  If you want your order to be filled immediately then you must use a market order.</p>
                                <p>
                                When placing a limit order to buy an option, you should set the price slightly below the ask. Specifically, subtract 1/3 of the bid-ask spread from the ask price.</p>

                                When placing a limit order to sell an option, you should set the price slightly above the bid. Specifically, add 1/3 of the bid-ask spread to the bid price.</p>
