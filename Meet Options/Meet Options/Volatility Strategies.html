                            When important news is expected on a stock that will likely cause the price of the stock to either drop or rise significantly, you can play that volatility with a long straddle.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            Buy both a call and a put for the same stock. When you confirm the direction of the stock&#39;s movement after the important news, sell the losing option right away for a small loss and ride the winner for a large profit.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            If the stock doesn&#39;t move significantly in either direction, then immediately sell both options for a small loss.</td>
