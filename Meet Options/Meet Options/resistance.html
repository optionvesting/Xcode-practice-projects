                            <h3>	DEFINITION: an imaginary line on a stock chart that represents a price that the stock can&#39;t seem to climb above. The more times a stock price has climbed towards the resistance and then fallen back down, the stronger the resistance becomes.</h3>
                                <p>
                                Resistance is the opposite of support.</p>
                                <p>
                                As a part of technical analysis, resistance and support levels are used by many traders to formulate trading strategies. For example, if a stock is approaching a very strong resistance level, a trader may become bearish on the stock. Thus, the trader would close any bullish positions on the stock, or open bearish positions.</p>
                                <p>
                                Once a stock is able to break through the resistance level and climb above it, the resistance level often becomes a support level.</p>
                                <p>
                                A stock that continually bounces between support and resistance is often called a "channeling" or "wave" stock.</p>
                                <p>
                                The chart below shows a stock with a resistance level at about $53 and a support level at about $48.</p>
