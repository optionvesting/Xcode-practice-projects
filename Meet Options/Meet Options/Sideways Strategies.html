                            Covered calls are a low risk option strategy. They&#39;re not very exciting, yet they provide consistent gains when executed correctly.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            They are the safest way to take advantage of time value decay.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            In order to sell covered calls:<br />
                            
                            ➫ Find a stock that is unlikely to depreciate significantly (ideally a stock that your are bullish on)<br />
                            
                            ➫ Buy the stock in increments of 100 shares<br />
                            
                            ➫ Sell an out-of-the-money call contract for each 100 shares of the underlying stock that you bought or already own.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            If the call expires out-of-the-money, your profit is the credit that was placed into your account when you sold the call.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            If the call expires in-the-money, then your stock automatically gets sold at the strike price of the call you sold, which is a higher price than you paid for it
                            
                            .<br />
                            
                            <br />If you want to have an even higher probability of profit, and don't mind getting slightly lower returns, you can sell an in-the-money call instead of an out-of-the-money call.  Since an in-the-money call will usually have less time value than one that is slightly out-of-the-money, that means you won't make as much profit.  However, it increases the likelihood for profit, since you will still make money even if the underlying stock loses a little value.
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            <br />Covered calls are a great strategy because they can be repeated on a regular basis: weekly on stocks that have weekly options, or monthly for other stocks.
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            <br />Also, if you don't have enough cash to buy 100 shares of the stock you want to buy in order to open a covered call trade, there are some stocks that now offer "mini" options, that deal with 10 shares of stock per contract instead of 100 shares of stock like traditional options.
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            <br />If a stock offers mini options, then you can buy shares of the stock in increments of 10 and sell mini options.  To determine how many mini option contracts to sell, simply divide the number of shares you purchased by 10, and you will be able to sell that many covered calls.
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            <br />Some stocks that offer mini options are Apple, Google, and Amazon.

                            As long as the stock price stays above your bull-put spread and below your bear-call spread, all the options remain out-of-the-money and expire worthless.<br />

                            You get the double the profit you would from either spread by itself. So you have higher profit potential, but more attention is required since you have to unwind or roll positions if the stock climbs or drops too much.</td>
