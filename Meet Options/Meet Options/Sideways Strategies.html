                            When you sell a naked call, you make your maximum profit and keep your entire initial credit if the stock goes down, stays flat, or even goes up a little, as long as it stays below the strike price of the call you sell.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            By selling an out-of-the-money call, you benefit from time decay:<br />
                            
                            ➫ If the underlying stock price goes down, the intrinsic value and the time value of the call you sold goes down (which is what you want since you might have to buy it back eventually)<br />
                            
                            ➫ If the underlying stock price goes stays flat, the time value of the call you sold still goes down<br />
                            
                            ➫ If the underlying stock price goes up, the time value of the call you sold goes up (not what you want since you might have to buy it back)<br />
                            
                            As long as the underlying stock is below the strike price of the out-of-the-money call you sold, you keep your maximum profit. The call you sold expires out-of-the-money and is worthless, so you don&#39;t ever even have to buy it back.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            To increase your probability of profit, sell a call that is well out-of-the-money. That will increase the probability that the call will still be out-of-the-money when it expires, making it worthless. Then you don&#39;t have to buy it back ever.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            To increase your maximum profit, sell a call that is still out-of-the-money, but closer to the current price of the underlying stock. The closer the call is to being in-the-money when you sell it, the more time value it will have, and thus more maximum profit for you.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            As a good balance between probability of profit and maximum profit, select a call to sell that is roughly between 5% and 10% out-of-the-money.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            When choosing an underlying stock for selling a naked call, make sure you are bearish on the stock. It is also wise to avoid selling naked calls on stocks that have important announcements (such as earnings) prior to the expiration date of the option you want to sell.</td>

                            A bear-call spread is very much like selling a naked call, except that you protect your position by buying a cheaper call in order to limit your maximum loss. However, the downside of a bear-call spread in comparison with selling a naked call is that the cost of buying the call decreases your maximum profit. A bear-call spread decreases your maximum loss and maximum profit.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            Since your maximum loss is lower than with selling a naked call, only options level 2 is required instead of options level 4.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            A bear-call spread is a type of credit spread. That means that at the time you open the position, money gets put into your brokerage account.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            To execute a bear-call spread:<br />
                            
                            ➫ determine a price above which you don&#39;t expect the underlying stock to rise above<br />
                            
                            ➫ sell an out-of-the-money call at that strike price<br />
                            
                            ➫ buy the call one strike price further out-of-the-money to protect your position.<br />
                            
                            Since the call you sell brings in more money than you spend on the call you buy, you get a net credit in your account.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            As long as the calls expire out of the money, you keep the credit.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            If the stock price climbs above the strike price of the call you sold (the short leg of the spread), there are a few ways you can close the position before expiration:<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            ➫ 1. If you are approved for the highest level of options trading and have sufficient cash in your account to cover a short naked position, then sell the call you bought (the long leg of the spread) for a profit. Then if the call you sold (the short leg of the spread) expires in-the-money, your broker will automatically buy you 100 shares of the stock for each contract at the current market price of the stock, and sell them at the strike price of the call you sold for a loss.<br />
                            
                            ➫ 2. Close both legs of the bear-call spread by buying back the call you sold, and selling the call you bought to open. This course of action will likely result in a loss.<br />
                            
                            ➫ 3. Using an option chain, find the next expiration date (which will be the following Friday if weeklies are available on the stock, or the 3rd Friday of the next month if only monthlies are available). If you think the price will drop down by that next expiration date, you can &quot;roll&quot; your spread. Simply close both legs of your spread and open the same spread at the next expiration date.</td>

                            ➫ If the stock goes down, your option will gain intrinsic value, but will also lose some time value, so you might make money. The stock has to go down enough so that the value of your option will go up even with time value decay.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            You can increase your chances of making money with your naked option position, if the put you buy:<br />
