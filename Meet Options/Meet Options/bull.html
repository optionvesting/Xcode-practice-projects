                            <h3>DEFINITION: an investor who believes that the value of a particular stock or market is going to increase.</h3>
                            <p>
                            To remember that a bull is expecting prices to increase, visualize a bull slashing upward with its horns.</p>
                            <p>
                            Bulls attempt to profit from an increase in prices. Bulls are generally optimistic about a particular stock or the market as a whole.</p>
                            <p>
                            For example, if an investor is bullish on Google stock, they will use a strategy to attempt to profit from the stock&#39;s rise in price.</p>
                            <p>
                            A bull is the opposite of a bear, who believes that a stock, sector, or market is going to drop in price.</p>
                            <p>
                            Using stocks, the only way for a bull to profit is with a long position. Using options, there are many strategies, both long and short, that a bull can use to profit.</p>
