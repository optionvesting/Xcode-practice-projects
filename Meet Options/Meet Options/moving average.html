                                The chart of Under Armour (UA) below shows a 20 day simple moving average (SMA) in red and a 50 SMA in green.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                <img src="moving average.jpg" style="height: 224px; width: 300px;" />
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                A decreasing moving average indicates the stock is bearish. An increasing moving average indicates the stock is bullish.</p>
                                <p>
                                When the shorter term moving average crosses the longer term moving average, that indicates momentum. An example of bullish momentum can be seen in Feb &#39;13 on the chart above. At that time the red crossed above the green line, indicating bullish momentum. Since then, the stock has continued to increase 20%.</p>                        </td>
