                            When you sell a naked put, you make your maximum profit and keep your entire initial credit if the stock goes up, stays flat, or even goes down a little, as long as it stays above the strike price of the put you sell.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            By selling an out-of-the-money put, you benefit from time decay:<br />
                            
                            ➫ If the underlying stock&#39;s price goes up, the intrinsic value and the time value of the put you sold goes down (which is what you want since you might have to buy it back eventually)<br />
                            
                            ➫ If the underlying stock&#39;s price stays flat, the time value of the put you sold still goes down<br />
                            
                            ➫ If the underlying stock&#39;s price goes down, the time value of the put you sold goes up (not what you want since you might have to buy it back)<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            As long as the underlying stock&#39;s price is above the strike price of the out-of-the-money put you sold, you keep your maximum profit. The put you sold expires out-of-the-money and is worthless, so you don&#39;t ever even have to buy it back.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            To increase your probability of profit, sell a put that is well out-of-the-money. That will increase the probability that the put will still be out-of-the-money when it expires, making it worthless. Then you don&#39;t have to buy it back ever.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            To increase your maximum profit, sell a put that is still out-of-the-money, but closer to the current price of the underlying stock. The closer the put is to being in-the-money when you sell it, the more time value it will have, and thus more maximum profit for you.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            As a good balance between probability of profit and maximum profit, select a put to sell that is roughly between 5% and 10% out-of-the-money.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            When choosing an underlying stock for selling a naked put, make sure you are bullish on the stock. It is also wise to avoid selling naked puts on stocks that have important announcements (such as earnings) prior to the expiration date of the option you want to sell.</td>

                            A bull-put spread is very much like selling a naked put, except that you protect your position by buying a cheaper put in order to limit your maximum loss. However, the downside of a bull-put spread in comparison with selling a naked put is that the cost of buying the put decreases your maximum profit. A bull-put spread decreases your maximum loss and maximum profit.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            Since your maximum loss is lower than with selling a naked put, the highest level of options trading approval is not required.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            A bull-put spread is a type of credit spread. That means that at the time you open the position, money (sometimes called a &quot;net credit&quot;) gets put into your brokerage account.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            To execute a bull put spread:<br />
                            
                            ➫ determine a price below which you don&#39;t expect the underlying stock to drop below<br />
                            
                            ➫ sell an out-of-the-money put at that strike price<br />
                            
                            ➫ buy the put one strike price further out-of-the-money to protect your position.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            Since the put you sell brings in more money than you spend on the put you buy, you get a net credit in your account.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            As long as the puts expire out of the money, you keep the credit.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            If the stock price drops below the strike price of the put you sold, there are a few ways you can close the position before expiration:<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            ➫ 1. If you are approved for the highest level of options trading and have sufficient cash in your account to cover a short naked position, then sell the put you bought (the long leg of the spread) for a profit. Then if the put you sold (the short leg of the spread) expires in-the-money, your broker will automatically buy you 100 shares of the stock for each contract at the strike price of the put you sold.<br />
                            
                            ➫ 2. Close both legs of the bull-put spread by buying back the put you sold, and selling the put you bought to open. This course of action will likely result in a loss.<br />
                            
                            ➫ 3. Using an option chain, find the next expiration date (which will be the following Friday if weeklies are available on the stock, or the 3rd Friday of the next month if only monthlies are available). If you think the price will bounce back up by that next expiration date, you can &quot;roll&quot; your spread. Simply close both legs of your spread and open the same spread at the next expiration date.</td>

                            <br />
                            
                            You can increase your chances of making money with your naked option position, if the call you buy:<br />
