                            <h3>	DEFINITION: a fee or service charge that clients pay to their broker. Brokers charge commissions for placing trades, providing advice, and other services.</h3>
                                <p>
                                Each broker or brokerage has a different commission schedule. Commissions provide the primary source of income for brokers.</p>
                                <p>
                                Most brokers charge a flat commission for stock orders, regardless of the number of shares purchased.</p>
                                <p>
                                Conversely, commissions for option trades usually change depending on how many contracts are ordered. The more contracts ordered, the higher the commission will be usually.</p>
                                <p>
                                Commission fees are one of the most important discriminators to evaluate when selecting a broker.</p>
