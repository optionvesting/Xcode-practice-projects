                            Remember that an option is a contract that allows you to buy or sell a stock at a specified price. That specified price is called the strike price.<br />
                            <br />
                            Let&#39;s go back again to the stock XYZ example where the stock&#39;s price is $50 per share. In that example we used the $40 call, which allows you buy the stock at $40 a share. The strike price of that option is $40.<br />
                            <br />
                            Business XYZ would also issue other calls at other strike prices in $2.50 increments. There would also be a $42.50 call, a $45.00 call, etc.<br />
                            <br />
                            Cheaper stocks that sell for around $10 a share issue options at $1.00 strike price increments.<br />
                            <br />
                            More expensive stocks that sell for over $200 per share only issue options in $5 strike price increments.<br />
                            <br />
                            Most businesses that sell stock options offer many different strike prices of options (in the increments listed above).<br />
                            <br />
                            To see the options available for a given stock, first search for the ticker on Yahoo! or Google finance and look at the stock quote. Then on the left side of the stock quote you&#39;ll see a link for the option chain (it may just say &quot;options&quot; instead of &quot;option chain&quot; depending on what site you&#39;re using). An example option chain is shown below.</td>

                            The option chain shows all available options for a given stock, organized by expiration date and strike price. If the chain shows the calls and puts side-by-side that is called a &quot;straddle&quot; view of the option chain. If the calls are listed above the puts, that is called the &quot;stacked&quot; view. Some websites show the straddle view by default, while other websites default to the stacked view. &nbsp;The screenshot above is a stacked view.<br />

                            At the time I pulled this option chain for CAT (Caterpillar), the stock was trading for $86.78. You can see that these options are the July options, and they expire on the 20th of the month (the Saturday after the 3rd Friday of the month).<br />

                            Just like the price of a stock, the price of an option is defined by a market maker in the form of a BID and ASK price. The BID is what the market maker pays if you sell options back to him, and the higher ASK is what you pay to buy the options from him.<br />
                            <br />
                            The price of the option is set by the market maker based on the sum of the intrinsic and time value in each option.<br />
                            <br />
                            Intrinsic Value of a call = Stock Price - Strike Price<br />
                            Intrinsic Value of a put = Strike Price - Stock Price.<br />
                            <br />
                            Take a look at the CAT option chain above, specifically the $85 strike price call.<br />
                            <br />
                            ➫ The stock is currently priced at $86.78.<br />
                            ➫ The ability to buy the stock for $85, which is exactly what the $85 call would allow you to do, is worth $1.78 to you right now.<br />
                            ➫ That $85 call has $1.78 of intrinsic value, so it is currently in-the-money, which is why it is highlighted yellow.<br />
                            ➫ Notice the price of the $85 call isn&#39;t $1.78 per share, it&#39;s $4.00 per share. That&#39;s because there is also time value in the option, since it has a couple months of time before it expires.<br />
                            ➫ The $85 call has $1.78 of intrinsic value and $2.22 of time value.<br />
                            <br />
                            The time value accounts for the possibility that the stock price will change sometime before the option expires in two months.<br />
                            <br />
                            So the price of an option, as set by the market maker, is the sum of the intrinsic value and the time value.<br />
                            <br />
                            Option Price = Time Value + Intrinsic Value<br />
                            <br />
                            Now let&#39;s look at the $85 put option on the right side. Notice that it&#39;s not highlighted in yellow, meaning it is out-of-the-money. That is because the $85 put doesn&#39;t have any real, intrinsic value right now.<br />
                            <br />
                            The stock is trading at $86.78 per share, so an $85 put that would let you sell the stock for $85 isn&#39;t worth anything right now.<br />
                            <br />
                            But the price the market maker set for the $85 put isn&#39;t $0, it&#39;s $2.46 per share. That is because the option doesn&#39;t expire for a couple months, just like the call, so it has time value.<br />
                            <br />
                            The intrinsic value of the $85 put is $0, and the time value is $2.46.<br />
                            <br />
                            As demonstrated above, intrinsic value is determined by a mathematical formula and can&#39;t be modified by the market maker. Conversely, the market maker can adjust the time value of an option. There is no exact mathematical formula used by the market maker to set the time value.<br />
                            <br />
                            It is important to understand how to calculate time value. You will always know the price of the option (from the option chain) and the intrinsic value (based on the formulas above), so then you can calculate the time value of the option:<br />
                            <br />
                            Time Value = Option Price - Intrinsic Value</td>

                            If you look at the option chain above, you can see the volume of each option. The number to the right of the volume is the open interest.<br />
                            <br />
                            Open interest is related to volume, but different.<br />
                            <br />
                            ➫ Volume is how many trades occurred so far that day.<br />
                            ➫ Open interest is the total number of trades for the given option, since the day that option was first issued, that have been opened and are not yet closed.<br />
                            <br />
                            As more and more people learn the benefits of trading options, the volume of option trading has increased pretty dramatically over recent years.<br />
                            <br />
                            Interestingly though, since so few people have discovered options, the volume of options trades is still much lower than that of stocks.<br />
                            <br />
                            This difference in volume between stocks and options is an important point to consider:<br />
                            <br />
                            ➫ Market makers trading stocks make their money by processing large volumes of trades. As long as the BID-ASK spread is at least a penny or two, and they process a lot of trades, they will make money.<br />
                            ➫ Market makers trading options process far fewer trades, so they need a larger BID-ASK spread in order to make money.<br />
                            <br />
                            Beware of the large gap between the BID and ASK prices when dealing with option market makers.</td>

                        <td>
                            Let&#39;s look at how the BID-ASK spread can negatively affect you when trading options.<br />
                            <br />
                            ➫ The BID price for option X is $1.80<br />
                            ➫ The ASK is $2.10<br />
                            ➫ Notice the large BID-ASK spread of $0.30, which is about 15%.<br />
                            ➫ Remember a market order is when you pay the market maker&#39;s full asking price.<br />
                            ➫ You place a market order to buy one contract of option X<br />
                            ➫ You will pay the ASK which is $2.10 per share ($210 total).<br />
                            ➫ You then place a market order to sell your one contract of option X<br />
                            ➫ The market maker will only pay you $1.80 per share ($180 total) for your option<br />
                            <br />
                            Even though the market maker never changed the BID and ASK prices of the option, you lost $30 just due to the BID-ASK spread. That&#39;s 15%!<br />
                            <br />
                            The best technique for trading options that have a large spread between the BID and the ASK, is to place a limit order instead of a market order. Limit orders allow you to set a price.<br />
                            <br />
                            To place a limit order:<br />
                            <br />
                            ➫ divide the BID-ASK spread into thirds<br />
                            ➫ subtract that amount from the ASK if you are buying the option<br />
                            ➫ add that amount to the BID when you are selling the option<br />
                            <br />
                            For the example above:<br />
                            <br />
                            ➫ the BID-ASK spread is $0.30 per share<br />
                            ➫ Divide that into thirds to get $0.10 per share<br />
                            ➫ Subtract that from the ASK price of $2.10 to get $2.00<br />
                            ➫ Place your limit order to buy the option for $2.00 instead of $2.10, reducing the money you lose from the BID-ASK spread by 33%.<br />
                            ➫&nbsp;When you sell the option, place your limit order at $1.90 which is $0.10 above the BID, reducing the money you lose from the BID-ASK spread by another 33%.<br />
                            <br />
                            When you use this technique of placing limit orders instead of market orders, it will save you 33% of the BID-ASK spread when opening your position and another 33% when closing the position.<br />
                            <br />
                            Therefore, anytime you are placing trades with a significant BID-ASK spread, it is wise to use the limit order technique. If you are placing trades with a small BID-ASK spread, it is easier to use a market order.<br />
                            <br />
                            If you use the rule of thirds as described above, the market maker will most likely fill your limit orders. Technically he doesn&#39;t have to, because the order isn&#39;t placed exactly at the BID or ASK prices, but he most likely will because he still gets some of the BID-ASK spread.<br />
                            <br />
                            If you place your order right at the BID or ASK price (i.e. a market order) then the market maker is required to fill the order immediately.</td>

                            If the open interest of a particular option is less than 100, it would be wise to look for another option to trade instead. That is because with low volume and open interest on an option, the market maker is paying VERY close attention to every order that is placed. When you put your order in, the market maker is likely to start artificially changing the price of the option in order to make more profit, assuming you are an uneducated options investor (which you are not going to be!).<br />
                            <br />
                            When placing limit orders on an option with low volume and open interest, you will place your order to buy the option, and instantly you will see the price of the option go up by 10 or 15% instantly!<br />
                            <br />
                            Don&#39;t get flustered, the market maker is just trying to make extra profit. Place your limit order and wait. He&#39;s hoping that when you see the price going up you will then change your order to the higher price.<br />
                            <br />
                            After a couple of minutes he&#39;ll realize that you know better, and he&#39;ll bring the price back down and fill your order.<br />
                            <br />
                            These artificial changes in price will happen less frequently and to a lesser degree if you are trading options with higher volume and higher open interest, because the market maker has more orders to deal with than just yours. However, you will still see the market maker changing the price artificially at times.</td>
