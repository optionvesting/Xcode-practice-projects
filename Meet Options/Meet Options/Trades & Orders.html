        <p1>Myths about orders.</p1></p>

                            There is a common misconception about how orders are used to trade stocks. The myth goes like this:<br />
                            
                            ➫ when you want to buy or sell a stock, you place an order via the exchange<br />
                            
                            ➫ your order sits at the exchange, waiting for some other investor that wants to take it<br />
                            
                            ➫ somehow the orders get matched and the trade happens<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            This is not really the case. In reality there are people called &quot;market makers&quot; whose job it is to sell you stock when you want to buy it, and buy your stock when you want to sell it.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            If you want to buy some stock, the market maker will sell it to you. When you want to sell it back, he&#39;s going to buy it from you.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            The trick of course is that the market maker sets the price. It&rsquo;s important to understand that when you place an order you&rsquo;re dealing with the market maker, not another random trader.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            Buying from or selling securities to the market maker is called an order, or trade.</td>

        <p1>Mr. Market Maker.</p1></p>

                            If you want to buy or sell a security, you have to meet the market maker&#39;s set price. This price has two pieces known as the BID and the ASK.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            ➫ The BID (always lower) is the amount you get if you&#39;re selling stock to the market maker.<br />
                            
                            ➫ The ASK (always higher) is the amount you pay if you&#39;re buying the stock.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            Analyze that closely. Every trade creates cash flow for the market maker because he sells stock to us at the ASK, which is more than what he pays when he buys our shares back at the BID.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            The difference between the BID and ASK prices are usually a few cents for cheap stocks like SIRI (SiriusXM) or up to a dollar for more expensive stocks like GOOG (Google).<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            The market maker is constantly receiving and filling orders during the hours the stock market is open. For the american stock market, those hours are 9:30 am - 4:00 pm EST Monday through Friday (except for government holidays). Before the market opens, pre-market trading is available from 7:00 am - 9:30 EST. After-hours trading is also available, from 4:00 pm - 8:00 pm EST.</td>

                            Looking at SIRI a little closer, 47 million shares of its stock were traded today. With a 3 penny spread between the BID and the ASK on each transaction, that&#39;s roughly $1.5 million in cash flow today made by the market maker.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            Of course we are simplyfing this subject, but the important concept to grasp is that market makers want transactions. They can make money whether a stock moves up or down much, as long there is a large volume of trading.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            The market maker only pays the BID when he buys stock from you, and you pay the higher ASK when you buy from him.</td>

                            To find the market maker&#39;s current prices for a given stock, you get a stock quote (see the example quote below retrieved from Google finance). The quote shows the BID (what he pays), the ASK (what you pay), as well as a wealth of other information. .</p>

                            Notice the BID and the ASK are shown in smaller font. The large number ($609.54) is called the LAST price. The LAST price is the price of the most recent order filled by the market maker.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            The quote above was retrieved after normal trading hours (5:17 pm EST), so in that example the LAST price is also the same as the CLOSE price, which means the price of the last order filled for the day before the market closed.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            If you retrieve the quote during after-hours or pre-market trading on a free website like Google finance, the LAST is the only price you are likely to see. In order to see the BID and ASK prices during extended trading hours, you will likely need to get your stock quote from your brokerage website.<br />

                            If you look at the chart for just about any stock these days, the price fluctuates like wild. Everyday each stock has a high and low price that it reached that day, and it probably bounced between them many times.<br />

                            Due to the shear volume of trades of typical stocks on large exchanges, each individual trader is essentially a nobody to the market maker.

                            The list literally goes on forever. All these factors combine to affect the supply and demand for each company&#39;s stock, and the desire of investors to risk their money.<br />
