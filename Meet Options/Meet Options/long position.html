                            <h3>	DEFINITION: buying a stock or option to sell it later at a higher price for profit. Most casual investors only know how to open and close long positions, and don&#39;t know how to use short positions. They hope to buy a stock low and then sell high.</h3>
                                If you buy a stock and plan to sell it later for a profit, you are "long" on that stock. If you own McDonald&#39;s stock you are "long McDonald&#39;s."

                                A long position on stock is the most basic strategy used by bullish investors.</p>

                                A long position is the opposite of a short position. A short position means selling a stock or option with the expectation it will decrease in value so you can buy it back later.</p>

                                With a short position, you sell high and then buy low.</p>
