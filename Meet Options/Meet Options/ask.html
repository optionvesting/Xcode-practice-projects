        <h3>DEFINITION: the price at which the market maker will sell you a security (i.e. the price the market maker is "ask"-ing for the security).</h3>
        <p>Sometimes the ask price is simply referred to as "the ask." The ask price is always higher than the bid price.</p>
        <p>If you place a market order to buy a security, you will pay the full ask price.</p>
        <p>If you use a limit order to buy a security, you can usually buy the security for slightly less than the ask.</p>
        <p>The ask is the opposite of bid, which is the price the market maker is willing to pay for a security.</p>
