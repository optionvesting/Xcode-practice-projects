                            Now that you have a basic understanding of investing, let&#39;s open up your mind and talk about how options can open opportunities.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            An option is a contract that allows you to control stock. Let me repeat: an option is a contract that allows you to control stock. One last time: an option is a contract that allows you to control stock.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            There are only two basic categories of options: call options and put options, which I will refer to as calls and puts from here on out.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            ➫ A call is a contract that allows you to BUY stock at a certain price.<br />
                            
                            ➫ A put is a contract that allows you to SELL stock at a certain price.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            Options are another type of security, meaning you can buy them and sell them and trade them. Options are bought and sold at an exchange, much like a stock. Almost all option trades occur at the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE).<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            While stocks allow you to control a share of a business, options let you control shares of stock. Options themselves are not tied to any physical asset, meaning they don&#39;t represent ownership of a business like stocks do. The value of an option is based on the stock they control.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            When you buy stocks, you can buy them one share at a time. When you buy options, you can buy them one contract at a time.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            One option contract controls 100 shares of stock. Again, one option contract controls 100 shares of stock.</td>

                            Let&#39;s say stock XYZ is currently trading for $50, and look at a couple scenarios to show you how calls and puts work.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            ➫ Scenario 1 - If I gave you a call option that would allow you to purchase 100 shares of the stock at $40 a piece, you&#39;d gladly take it and run, right? Remember, a call option is a contract that lets you buy 100 shares of stock at a specific price.<br />
                            
                            ➫➫ You could buy the 100 shares of stock XYZ for $40 each using the option contract I gave you for a total cost of $4,000.<br />
                            
                            ➫➫ Then you could turn and sell them right away for $50 each on the market for a total of $5,000.<br />
                            
                            ➫ You would clear $10 per share, for a profit of $1,000! That&#39;d be awesome right?<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            ➫ Scenario 2 - If I gave you a put option that would allow you to sell 100 shares of stock XYZ at $60 each, you&#39;d love that wouldn&#39;t you! Remember, a put allows you to sell 100 shares of stock at a specific price.<br />
                            
                            ➫➫ First you&#39;d buy 100 shares of stock through your broker for the current market price of $50 for a total cost of $5,000.<br />
                            
                            ➫➫ Then you&#39;d use your put option to immediately sell the stocks for $60 each, for a total sale of $6,000.<br />
                            
                            ➫ You just cleared $10 per share, for a profit of $1,000! That is how put options are beneficial.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            The specific price at which the option allows you to buy or sell the stock is called the strike price.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            ➫ In scenario 1 above, the strike price of the call option would be $40, since that call allows you to buy stock XYZ for $40 a share regardless of the market price for the stock.<br />
                            
                            ➫ In scenario 2 above, the strike price of the put option would be $60, since that put allows you to sell stock XYZ for $60 a share regardless of the market price for the stock.</td>

                            If I gave you a call that would let you buy 100 shares for $40 each, how much would that call option be worth to you? $10 per share, since it allows you to buy a stock for $40 when the current market value of the stock is $50.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            Think of the call as a coupon that gives you a $10 discount per share, so the call is actually worth $10 per share. That actual worth is called intrinsic value.<br />

                            <br />
                            
                            A call option has intrinsic value when the strike price is less than the market maker&#39;s current price for the stock. A call option with intrinsic value lets you buy 100 shares of stock for less than the market maker&#39;s price.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            A put option has intrinsic value when the strike price is more than the market maker&#39;s current price for the stock. A put option with intrinsic value lets you sell 100 shares of stock for more than the market maker&#39;s price.</td>

                            What if I offered you a call that allowed you to buy stock XYZ for $60 when you could go buy it on the market for $50. That wouldn&#39;t be worth anything to you at the moment. That option doesn&#39;t have any intrinsic value, because it&#39;s not currently worth anything to you.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            But what if you keep it for a while? Couldn&#39;t the market maker&#39;s price for stock XYZ go up to $70 next week?<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            Even though that option has no intrinsic value right now, it does have time (or extrinsic) value, meaning that some time in the future it might have real value.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            So you decide to keep that call option for a while. Let&#39;s say the stock has some good news reports, things are looking up for the business, and the price of the stock goes up to $70 per share.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            Remember, you kept your call option that still lets you buy for $60! Now that call has an intrinsic value of $10 per share, because it lets you buy for $60 when the market price has gone up to $70.<br />

                            In general, it only makes sense to execute an option if it is in-the-money. Remember, an out-of-the-money option doesn&#39;t have any intrinsic value, so executing it will not make you any money.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            Let&#39;s say I give you a stock XYZ call option at the $40 strike price. The stock is currently trading for $50 a share, so the option currently has $10 of intrinsic value.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            Since the option has intrinsic value, you can either execute it now and take some profit, or you can wait in the hopes that it will have more intrinsic value in the near future.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            ➫ If you choose to execute the option right now, you will buy 100 shares of stock XYZ for $40, sell it for $50, and take your profit of $1,000.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            ➫ If you choose to hold the option and the price of the stock goes up to $60 a share, you can still execute your $40 call and buy 100 shares of the stock for $40 each. Then you will sell the stock immediately at $60 a share, and take $2,000 profit.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            In the second scenario, by waiting to execute the option, your profit doubled even though the stock only went up 20% (from $50 to $60).<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            Each option contract can only be used once, which is called execution. It makes sense to execute an option any time it is in-the-money, because you will take a profit. It doesn&#39;t make sense to execute an option when it is out-of-the-money, because you will lose money.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            Here&#39;s an example demonstrating why you wouldn&#39;t want to execute out-of-the-money options. If you have a $60 stock XYZ call option and the market value is $50 a share, there is no real value and it wouldn&#39;t make sense to execute the option. If you did execute your $60 call, you would buy 100 shares of XYZ for $60 each, when you could have bought them at the market price of $50 each.</td>

                            Every option has an expiration date, and after that expiration date it can no longer be executed.<br />

                            ➫ 2. If the option is out-of-the-money then it will expire worthless and not be executed, because it doesn&#39;t make sense to execute out-of-the-money options.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            An expired out-of-the-money option has no worth or intrinsic value. It also has no time value, because it has expired and has no chance to ever gain intrinsic value.<br />

                            For a long time, all options expired on the Saturday after the 3rd Friday of each month. These options are called &quot;monthly options&quot; or &quot;monthlies&quot; and are still the most common type of option. Monthly options are typically issued by businesses with 3-6 months of time before they expire.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            Some businesses also sell yearly options, called LEAPS (Long-Term Equity Anticipation Securities). As the name &quot;yearly option&quot; implies, these options are first issued over one year before they expire.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            In the last decade or so, some businesses have started issuing stock options that expire only one week later. These options are called &quot;weekly options&quot; or &quot;weeklies.&quot; They are usually much cheaper than monthly options because they have much less time value.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            Once an option is issued, it can be traded (bought or sold) anytime before it expires. Even though all options expire on a Saturday, the last day you can trade that option is the Friday prior to expiration (the day before expiration) since the market is closed on Saturday.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            The most common options are still monthly options, and the last day they can be traded is the 3rd Friday of the month they expire.</td>
