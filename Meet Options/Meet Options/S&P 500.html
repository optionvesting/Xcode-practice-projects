                            <h3>	DEFINITION: an index that tracks 500 stocks, each of which is chosen based on market cap and other factors. The S&amp;P 500 is designed to be a leading benchmark of U.S. stock performance.</h3>
                                <p>
                                The S&amp;P Index Committee, a team of analysts and economists at Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s, selects the 500 stocks in the index. The S&amp;P 500 is a market value weighted index - each stock&#39;s weight is proportionate to its market value.</p>
                                <p>
                                Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s also has an index of small cap stocks called the S&amp;P 600, and an index of mid cap stocks called the S&amp;P 400.</p>
                                <p>
                                There are exchange traded funds (ETFs) and index funds that allow individual traders to achieve the same returns as the S&amp;P 500. Options are also available for trading on some of these funds (i.e. ticker symbol SPY).</p>
