                            <h3>	DEFINITION: a value that defines how much the price of an option changes in relation to the price of the underlying stock.</h3>
                                <p>
                                For example, if an option has a delta of .5, when the price of the underlying stock goes $1.00, the price of that option will go up about $0.50.</p>
                                <p>
                                Options with more time value than instrinsic value will have a lower delta, and are less volatile. Options with more intrinsic value have a higher delta, and their price will move more when the underlying stock price moves.</p>
                                <p>
                                The delta of an option changes constantly, as time and intrinsic values change.</p>
                                <p>
                                The delta of a call option is represented as a positive number, because the price of a call varies directly with the price of the underlying stock.</p>
                                <p>
                                The delta of a put option is represented as a negative number, because the price of a put varies indirectly (opposite) with the price of the underlying stock.</p>
