                            A broker is an individual, firm, or dealer that is regulated by the government and can buy or sell securities for you at an exchange. Nowadays many people use an internet broker like TDAmeritrade, tradeMONSTER, or OptionsHouse.
                            <br /><br />These brokerages provide robust and plentiful information to help you pick strategies and place trades, but they may or may not let you call and ask questions and get advice like a traditional full-service broker.
                            <br /><br />All brokers charge a commission every time you place a trade. This commission will be higher for a full-service broker (i.e. a real person you can call and talk to) and much lower for an online broker.
                            <br /><br />Since brokers get paid based on how many orders you place, they will often loan you some money to use for making trades. This is called a margin account, and is typically equal to the amount of cash you have in your account. Like any loan, you'll pay a small percentage fee whenever you place trades with the margin money.
                            <br /><br />So if you&#39;re approved for margin trading and you have $5k in your account you actually have $10k you can use to place orders.
                            <br />➫ When you close out the trades for a gain, the broker simply takes back his half of the money.  You keep all the money gained by the transaction.
                            <br />➫ Of course, if you lose money when you close the trade, it&#39;s your money that gets lost, and the broker will always get his money back. Think of a margin much like a loan.
                            <br /><br />More information about selecting a broker is available in later tutorials.</td>

                            When you are ready to buy or sell a security, you do it by placing an order. An order is the way you start and finish your trades. The first order opens your trade, and the second order closes your trade.
                            <br /><br />An order is simply you communicating to your broker:
                            <br />➫ what you want to buy or sell
                            <br />➫ how many shares (units) you want
                            <br />➫ when you want the order to be placed
                            <br />➫ what your price is
                            <br /><br />Your broker submits the orders and the market maker fills them. You just have to understand the lingo and then you can do what you want.</td>

        <p1>What is the lingo?</p1></p>
        <div class="CSSTableGenerator">
            <table>
                <tbody>

                        <td>
                            If you just want the order to be placed at the market maker&#39;s current price, that is called a market order. It will be filled almost immediately.
                            <br /><br />If you want to dictate the price of your order, that is called a limit order. It will be filled if/when the market maker&#39;s price matches your set price.
                            <br /><br />If you place a limit order to buy GOOG stock for $650 a share when the market maker is asking $700, guess what? The limit order won&#39;t be filled until the ASK price drops to $650.
                            <br /><br />In that case you would place a GTC (good &#39;til cancelled) order that your broker will submit to the market maker and it&#39;ll stay there until either:
                            <br />➫ the market maker's price aligns with your limit price and the order is filled
                            <br />➫ you decide to cancel it.
                            <br /><br />If you don&rsquo;t make your order GTC, then it will expire at the end of the day.

                            When you profit from trading securities, those profits are called capital gains. Of course, capital gains are taxed.<br />
                            <br />
                            ➫ Long Term: If you hold a security for more than 1 year and then sell it for a gain, it is taxed as a long-term capital gain at %15 (unless you&#39;re in the two lowest tax brackets and then you&#39;ll pay only 5% tax on capital gains).<br />
                            ➫ Short Term: If you hold the security for less than a year, then your capital gain will essentially be added to your normal income and taxed at your normal tax rate.<br />
                            <br />
                            It is also good to know that if you add up all your gains and losses for the year and end up with a capital loss, you get to deduct that amount from your taxable income. Up to $3k per year in fact.<br />
                            <br />
                            If you have a total capital loss for the year of more than $3k, then you get to carry the rest over to the next year, and then deduct it from your total income.<br />
                            <br />
                            The current capital gain tax rates as mentioned above are a result of the Bush-era tax cuts. If those cuts are not renewed soon, then capital gain tax will return to 20%.</td>

                            <br />
                            Many americans have Roth IRAs and use them for retirement preparation. Most of those people use their IRAs to trade mutual funds or exchange traded funds. Very few americans know that they can use their Roth IRA to trade stocks and options tax-free.<br />
