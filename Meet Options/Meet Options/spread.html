                            <h3>	DEFINITION 1: an options position established by purchasing one option and selling another option on the same stock. Each different option that is a part of the spread is called a "leg" of the spread.</h3>
                                <p>
                                There are many different option strategies that involve using spreads: calendar spreads, vertical spreads, bull-put spreads, bear-call spreads, etc.</p>
                                <p>
                                Most spreads are made up of a single short leg, and a single long leg.</p>
                                <p>
                                Trading spreads is less risky than trading naked options, while still allowing you to take advantage of time value decay.</p>
                                <p>
                                DEFINITION 2: the difference between the bid and the ask price of a security.</p>
                                <p>
                                Stocks that trade at a very low price, or at a very high volume, have a lower bid-ask spread.  Those with a very high price, or very low volume, have a higher bid-ask spread.  However, with stocks the bid-ask spread is usually very small compared to the price of the stock (i.e. less than 1%)</p>
                                <p>
                                With options, it is common to see a bid-ask spreads between 5% and 10%.  Because options can have a large bid-ask spread, it is often useful to trade using limit orders rather than market orders.</p>
