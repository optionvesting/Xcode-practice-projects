<td>Sounds easy enough, right?  You find a security that you think will increase in value, so you buy it.  After it goes up, you sell it.  This is the most commonly understood type of trade.

<br /><br />When you buy a security and plan to sell it later for a gain, that is called a long position.  Don't get confused thinking that long refers to length of the trade, in this sense it simply means you bought a security and plan to sell it at a higher price.

<br /><br />The way you start (open) a long position is called a Buy-To-Open (BTO) order.

<br /><br />You finish (close) the position once the price has gone up with a Sell-To-Close (STC) order.

<br /><br />The maximum loss possible with a long position is simply the amount of money you spent to buy the security, since the value of the security can fall all the way to zero.

<td>Another type of position is called a short position, which is the opposite of a long position.  It'll take a minute to wrap your brain around short positions if they're new to you so be patient and reread this section as necessary.  There is also a video tutorial that explains the subject for you visual learners.

<br /><br />Short positions (commonly referred to as "selling short") originated a while back as a way for brokers to make some extra money using their client's stock, and it started like this:

<br />

<br />➫ 1. Joe bought 10 shares of stock through his broker for $50 a piece, so his account was worth $500.

<br />➫ 2. Joe told his broker he planned to leave the 10 shares of stock in his account for a long time.

<br />➫ 3. Joe's broker had a hunch that the stock would decrease in value soon

<br />➫ 4. Joe's broker decided to sell the 10 shares for $50 without telling Joe and pocketed the $500, in the hopes that the price of the stock would drop.

<br />➫ 5. Later, as Joe's broker had hoped would happen, the price of the shares dropped to $25.

<br />➫ 6. Joe's broker used the $500 he pocketed to buy back the 10 of shares of stock, but it only cost him $250 since the stock was then trading for only $25 each.

<br />➫ 7. Joe's broker sold the stock first for $500, and then only spent $250 to buy the stock back, so he made $250!

<br />➫ 8. Joe's broker put the 10 shares of stock back into Joe's account without telling him.

<br /><br />Summary: The broker sold the shares at $50 and then bought them back at $25 for a $25 profit on each share, and the client never even knew!

<br /><br />What the broker did by selling the stocks first, then buying them back is called "selling short" or a "short position."

<br /><br />Although the fictitious story above about Joe and his broker seems a little fishy, and only something a broker could pull off, nowadays any trader has the opportunity to execute short positions.  There is nothing wrong or illegal about it.

<br /><br />Your broker doesn't actually take stock out of anyone's account.  Your broker simply has an agreement with the market maker that if you sell the stock first before you own it, you are obligated to buy it back eventually.

<br /><br />You initiate the short position by selling the stock (that you don't even own) with a Sell-To-Open (STO) order.  Then you end (close) the position with a Buy-To-Close (BTC) order through your broker.  Any modern brokerage will allow you to sell short, but of course you are required to buy back the stock back at sometime in the future (hopefully once the price is lower!) to close the short position.

<br /><br />The maximum loss possible with a short position is higher than that of a long position.  When you sell the security to open the position, the value of the security could then keep increasing, and your loss would keep increasing with it since you have to buy the stock back eventually to close the position.

<br /><br />Because of the higher maximum loss with short positions, they are considered to be more risky than long positions.  Managed well though, a short position is a great way to profit from a bearish market.

<br /><br />Short positions are also the best way to profit with options, which we’ll discuss later.</td>
