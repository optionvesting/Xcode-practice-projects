                                For example, if you put $1 million in your account and you achieve a 5% annual rate of return, your account will grow by $50,000 that first year. If at the end of that year you withdraw $50,000, your balance at the end of the year will be $1 million still, and you were able to withdraw $50,000! Next year your account gains another 5% and you withdraw another $50,000. You will be able to withdraw $50,000 every year while your account balance remains at $1 million infinitely.</p></p>
