                            <h3>	DEFINITION: opening a short position on a security. That means selling something that you don&#39;t already own, with the plan to buy it back later at a lower price. To profit from a short position, you first sell high and then buy low.</h3>

                                Selling short is a basic bearish strategy for stock trading. First, place a "sell-to-open" order. The money you make from selling the stock will go into your investment account, but the broker will place a hold on the money because you are required to buy the stock back later. After the stock has dropped in price, place a "buy-to-close" order.</p>

                                Selling short is the opposite of a long position. If you short sell McDonald&#39;s stock, you are "short McDonald&#39;s."</p>

                                Short positions are the key to consistent gains and profits with options trading, because they take advantage of time value decay.</p>
