                            <h3>	DEFINITION: An order placed with a broker to sell a security if it drops below a certain price. A stop-loss order is designed to limit an investor&#39;s loss by selling the security before it drops too much.</h3>
                                <p>
                                Also called a "stop order" or "stop-market order." Stop-loss orders are useful on long stock positions or long naked option positions.</p>

                                <p>
                                To execute a stop-loss order, determine how much you are willing to lose on a given trade, and set the stop-loss at that amount. Then if the stock or option starts dropping, your order will get filled, limiting your maximum loss.</p>

                                <p>
                                Stop-loss orders can also help remove emotional and irrational decision making from the trading process, by setting a maximum loss.</p>
