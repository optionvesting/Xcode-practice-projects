Most casual investors only know how to open and close long positions, and don&#39;t know how to use short positions. They hope to buy a stock low and then sell high later. Short positions allow traders to benefit from an expected decrease in price of a stock or option.</h3>
                                If you sell a stock and plan to buy it back later at a lower price, you are "short" that stock.
