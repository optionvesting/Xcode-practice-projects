                            In general, the option trades you make will be based on the underlying stock. This means that you will normally open or close option positions based on how the underlying stock is expected to change in value.
                            
                            <br /><br />In order to have an accurate and reasonable expectation of how a given stock price will change (or remain the same), it is essential to review as much information about the stock as possible.
                            
                            <br /><br />Although there&rsquo;s not one perfect checklist that fits every situation, you should follow some tried and tested rules of thumb as a starting point for your research.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            The more you know about a stock or sector of stocks, the better you can assess the current value of the stock and make an accurate assessment about how the stock will perform in the future. If you already have significant knowledge about a particular sector, that&rsquo;s a great place to start your trading.
                            
                            <br /><br />For example, if you have a degree in computer engineering and spend lots of time following the latest tech trends, then you should probably follow the tech sector.
                            
                            <br /><br />Start by getting quotes on a few of the leading tech stocks a couple times a week. Weeks will turn into months, and then years, and soon you will have a good feel for what causes tech stocks to go up and down. You'll learn what stocks are cyclical and seem to bounce back and forth predictably between support and resistance levels. You'll understand what stocks have a high potential of continued growth. And you'll be able to recognize what stocks are more like a bubble getting ready to burst.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            The best recommendation is to research stocks from several different angles, and look for multiple pieces of evidence that support the same conclusion. The following are examples of stock analysis that can be combined to make accurate assessments about how a stock is likely to perform in the future.</td>

                            One solid place to start is with stock upgrades and downgrades. Not because an upgrade means you should blindly open a bullish position. Nor should you blindly open a bearish position on a downgraded stock.
                            
                            <br /><br />The reason you can start your research with upgrades and downgrades is because those stocks are currently in the news, which means they are likely experiencing increased trade volume and will have more exaggerated changes in price. Recently upgraded/downgraded stocks have usually had large changes in their current earnings, expected future earnings, management, market share, or something else that will have an impact on the future value of the stock.
                            
                            <br /><br />However, the reason you shouldn&rsquo;t blindly open positions based on an upgraded or downgraded rating is because often those rating changes lag the market.
                            
                            <br /><br />For example, if a business announces during an earnings report that it is raising expected future earnings beyond analyst expectations, the stock price will normally rise right away, even that same day. Then a few days or weeks down the road, after the ratings agencies have processed that new information and developed a new price target for the stock, they will issue an upgrade.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            For longer term strategies (a couple weeks or more), bullish strategies will generally be profitable for upgraded stocks. Likewise bearish strategies will generally be profitable for downgraded stocks in the long term.
                            
                            <br /><br />However, with a short term position (a couple of days) the opposite is often true. It is counter-intuitive that a recently upgraded stock could decline for the next few days afterward, yet that is often the case.
                            
                            <br /><br />Let&rsquo;s go back to the previous example of a business that announces higher future earnings than previously expected. The following is a common chain of events that could follow such an announcement:
                            
                            <br />➫ 1. As soon as that information hits the market, the stock is likely to jump in value.
                            
                            <br />➫ 2. More investors and traders jump on that bandwagon and start buying the stock, increasing demand for the stock.
                            
                            <br />➫ 3. The market maker is able to artificially raise the price of the stock a little.
                            
                            <br />➫ 4. The increased demand drives the stock to become overbought.
                            
                            <br />➫ 5. A few days later the rating agencies catch up and the stock gets an upgraded rating.
                            
                            <br />➫ 6. At this point, the stock has already seen a price jump (partially warranted, partially artificial).
                            
                            <br />➫ 7. The stock will now likely decline a little in price as the dust settles, and demand drops back to normal levels.
                            
                            <br /><br />So your strategy immediately after an upgrade is often counter intuitive if you&rsquo;re making short term trades.
                            
                            <br /><br />For long term trades however, it is recommended to follow the upgrades, downgrades, and ratings of the professional analytical agencies.</td>

                            When you research an upgraded or downgraded business, first try to figure out what event(s) caused the rating to be changed. Then figure out when that event happened, and take note of the specific day.
                            
                            <br /><br />One easy way to figure out when the event happened is with Google finance, which plots different news events on stock charts so you can see how the stock changed in price as a result of the important news.
                            
                            <br /><br />Look at the stock chart over a 6 month window and add a few overlays (10 day Moving Average, 30 day Moving Average, and the slow stochastic):
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            <br />➫ Is today&rsquo;s date within a few days of the big event?
                            
                            <br />➫➫ If so, look at the stochastic and determine if the stock has made a drastic change over the last few days and is overbought (for an upgrade) or oversold (for a downgrade).
                            
                            <br />➫➫ If so, you could open a short-term position, expecting the stock to correct back in the opposite direction.
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            <br />➫ If it has been more than a few days since the big news, then look for a trend with the MA lines.
                            
                            <br />➫➫ If the 10 and 30 day moving averages are increasing for an upgraded stock, then open a bullish position.
                            
                            <br />➫➫ If the stock was downgraded, then look for the moving averages to decrease and open a bearish position.
                            
                            <br />➫➫ If you don't see the movement you expect from the moving averages (increasing for an upgraded stock, decreasing for a downgraded stock), then wait a few days until you see the averages make the expected move and then open your position.</td>

                            <br /><br />Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re looking at buying some Home Depot stock because your research shows it has every reason to increase in value, but tomorrow the number of new housing starts and building permits is about to be released. It might be better to wait until tomorrow to analyze that data, and then open your position if it still makes sense. If there is a large sudden change in construction related indicators, that could change the outlook for a stock like Home Depot.<br />

                            <br /><br />That same page of Yahoo! finance also provides a list of when each business will report earnings in the near future.
                            
                            <br /><br />Earnings reports can have a huge positive or negative effect on a stock if any surprises are announced in the conference call. So if you&rsquo;re opening a short term position, it might not be wise to do so right before an earnings call unless you are planning a trade to take advantage of volatility.
                            
                            <br /><br />It is also important to know that the earnings of a business can affect the stock price of all related stocks in the sector.
                            
                            <br /><br />For example, if Lowe&rsquo;s has a terrible earnings report, that will also likely have negative effects on the stock price of Home Depot. If John Deere reports higher demand for it&rsquo;s heavy equipment, Caterpillar stock will also likely increase.
