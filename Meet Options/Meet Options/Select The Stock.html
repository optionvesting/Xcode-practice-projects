                <tbody>
                    
                    <tr>

                            Regardless of the strategy you have selected, it is wise to have a predetermined exit strategy. Trading in today&rsquo;s volatile market often results in your investments gaining and/or losing money everyday.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            It is important to open positions with sound strategy and goals, and close positions with logic rather than emotion. An exit strategy will help keep you grounded.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            Exit strategies can be implemented in one of two ways:<br />
                            
                            ➫ As soon as you open a position, immediately place limit orders to close your position at a given gain/loss.<br />
                            
                            ➫ If your broker provides alerts (also known as triggers), you can set gain or loss criteria and have your broker automatically execute certain actions when those criteria are met. The actions that your broker can automatically execute include: placing an order to close the position, or sending text messages/emails informing you that the criterion is met so you can close your position on your own.</td>
                        
                    </tr>
                    
                </tbody>

        <p1>Lock gains, limit losses.</p1></p>
        
        <div class="CSSTableGenerator">
            
            <table>
                
                <tbody>
                    
                    <tr>
                        
                        <td>
                            
                            With naked options, your exit strategy should allow you to both lock-in gains and limit losses. As soon as the market maker fills the order to open your position, you can immediately set your exit strategy to automatically execute when your predetermined criteria are met.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            There are two simple methods that can help you lock-in gains and limit your losses:<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            1. Place two limit orders right away: one order to close the entire position for a limited loss; a second order to close half the contracts of the position for a gain.<br />
                            
                            ➫➫ If the position begins to lose money, the first order will close all the contracts of your position for a slight loss, thus limiting your loss.<br />
                            
                            ➫➫ If the position begins to make money, half the contracts will close to lock some gains, allowing the other half to continue to gain value.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            2. Place a trailing stop order below your entry price to close your entire position.<br />
                            
                            ➫➫ If the position loses enough money to hit your trailing stop, the entire position will close, thus limiting your loss.<br />
                            
                            ➫➫ If the position starts to gain money, the trailing stop loss will continue to rise also, locking in gains.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            For an example, let&#39;s look at stock XYZ.<br />
                            
                            ➫ It is currently trading at $100.<br />
                            
                            ➫ It has a well defined support level at $98, which it was at just at a few days ago.<br />
                            
                            ➫ The stochastic shows that stock XYZ is currently oversold but trending higher.<br />
                            
                            ➫ So buy some naked calls or sell some naked puts to open the position.<br />
                            
                            ➫ Then set your exit strategy to limit your losses at $97 in case something happens to the company or overall market that will drive the stock below the $98 support level to limit your loss.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            Credit Spreads also present an opportunity to lock gains. If you open a credit spread that quickly approaches max profit, you can close the position to lock those gains rather than wait for the options to expire.</td>
                        
                    </tr>
                    
                </tbody>
                
            </table>

            <table>
                
                <tbody>
                    
                    <tr>
                        
                        <td>
                            
                            With credit spreads, your exit strategy is normally just to wait for all legs of the spread to expire out-of-the-money. However, it can still be useful to set triggers to alert you if the stock is not moving in the planned direction.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            These alerts will help you to monitor your spread, and determine if you need to take action prior to expiration of the option contracts.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            If your position doesn&#39;t look like it will expire out-of-the-money as you expected, you can unwind the position by closing the entire position. You can also choose to close only the short leg of the position in the hope that the long leg you leave open will reverse directions and make you some more money.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            You also have the option to roll your credit spread to the next month if it looks like it is going to expire-in-the-money. To roll your position, simply close your current position, and open the same position (same options at the same strike prices) with next month&#39;s options. That will give your position more time to be profitable, but it may also compound your losses if it still remains in-the-money next month.</td>
