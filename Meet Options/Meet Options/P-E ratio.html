                            <h3>	DEFINITION: a ratio of a company&#39;s current share price compared to its per-share earnings.
                                To calculate P/E, divide a stock&#39;s price by it&#39;s Earnings Per Share (EPS).</h3>
                                <p>
                                For example, if a stock is currently trading at $100 a share and its earnings over the last 12 months were $10 per share, the P/E would be 10 ($100/$10). </p>
                                <p class="p1">
                                To calculate trailing P/E, use the EPS over the last four quarters. To calculate a projected P/E, use the expected EPS over the next 4 quarters.</p>
                                <p class="p1">
                                P/E is sometimes called a "price multiple" or "earnings multiple".</p>
                                <p class="p1">
                                Investors often compare the P/E of one stock to other stocks in the same sector. A high P/E relative to other stocks in the sector could indicate the stock is expected to have more growth than other stocks, or it is overpriced.</p>
                                <p class="p1">
                                P/E should never be used as a sole determining factor when deciding what stocks to buy or sell.</p>
