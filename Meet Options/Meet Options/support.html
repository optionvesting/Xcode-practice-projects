                            <h3>	DEFINITION: an imaginary line on a stock chart that represents a price that the stock can&#39;t seem to fall below. The more times a stock price has fallen towards the support and then bounces back up, the stronger the support becomes.</h3>
                                <p class="p1">
                                Resistance is the opposite of support.</p>
                                <p class="p1">
                                As a part of technical analysis, resistance and support levels are used by many traders to formulate trading strategies. For example, if a stock is approaching a very strong support level, a trader may become bullish on the stock. Thus, the trader would close any bearish positions on the stock, or open bullish positions.</p>
                                <p class="p1">
                                Once a stock falls through the support level, the old support level often becomes a new resistance level.</p>
                                <p class="p1">
                                A stock that continually bounces between support and resistance is often called a "channeling" or "wave" stock.</p>
                                <p class="p1">
                                The chart below (retrieved from Google Finance) shows a stock with a resistance level at about $53 and a support level at about $48.</p>
