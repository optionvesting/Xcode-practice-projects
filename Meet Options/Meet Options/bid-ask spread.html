                            <h3>DEFINITION: the difference between the ask price and the bid price. The ask price is always higher than the bid price.</h3>
                            <p>
                            For example, if the bid price is $50.50 and the ask price is $50.75 then the "bid-ask spread" is $0.25.</p>
                            <p>
                            Options generally have a much larger bid-ask spread than stocks.</p>
                            <p>
                            It is generally a good idea to use limit orders when there is a large bid-ask spread.</p>
