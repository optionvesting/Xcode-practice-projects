                    Let&#39;s all be honest. There is no magic crystal ball that can tell you with 100% accuracy which securities will go up or down and when.<br />
                    
                    <br />
                    
                    There are, however, fundamentals of any particular security that you can analyze to help you better understand the current value of a security and make an educated hypothesis about whether the value will increase or decrease.</p>
                    
                    <p>
                    
                    Even with proper analysis, stocks will sometimes move in the opposite direction of what you expected. &nbsp;That is the reason that options trading can help you achieve profits. &nbsp;If you are just trading stocks, you have to guess correctly the direction the stock will move to profit. &nbsp;With options, you can profit even if the price of the stock doesn&#39;t change at all, or even moves a little bit in the opposite direction of what you&#39;re expecting.</p>

                    If you want to understand the price of a stock, you need to understand the financial situation of that business. Specifically, you should ask three questions:<br />
                    
                    <br />
                    
                    ➫ 1. How much money is the business currently earning (or losing)?<br />
                    
                    ➫ 2. Have earnings been increasing or decreasing?<br />
                    
                    ➫ 3. How much money is the business expected to earn or lose in the future?<br />
                    
                    <br />
                    
                    The answers to these and other questions are available on free investing websites like Google finance and Yahoo! finance.<br />
                    
                    <br />
                    
                    Every quarter (four times per year), businesses disclose their underlying financial situation through what is called an earnings report. Earnings reports are scheduled far in advance, and the dates are public information available on the web.<br />
                    
                    <br />
                    
                    As a part of the report, the business typically releases how much profit they made the previous quarter, whether they made more or less profit than the same quarter of the previous year, and how much they expect to make over the next few upcoming quarters.<br />
                    
                    <br />
                    
                    Government regulations keep businesses honest in these reports, so they usually give a clear picture of how the business is doing.</td>

                    Analyzing earnings is more complex than that simple equation. Just because a business reports better earnings than the year prior, the value of the stock might still decrease if people were expecting an even better report.<br />
                    
                    <br />
                    
                    Conversely, if a business reports poor profit, the stock still might increase if the report was expected to be even worse.<br />
                    
                    <br />
                    
                    Knowledgeable financial analysts are constantly evaluating the performance of every business, and the price of the stock typically reflects the opinion of those analysts.<br />
                    
                    <br />
                    
                    To say that another way, expectations of the financial analysts are already built into the price of the stock. So it&#39;s not necessarily the earnings reported that make the stock price change, but any surprises in the report that analysts weren&#39;t expecting that will cause the stock price to change.</td>

<h1>It pays to own stocks.</h1></p>

                    Literally. Many stocks offer dividends to shareholders. Dividends are a small payment that some business pay to shareholders to encourage them to buy and hold their stock.<br />
                    
                    <br />
                    
                    Most dividends are paid quarterly to all people who hold shares of the stock on a certain date, called the ex-dividend date. The payments are actually made at a later date.<br />
                    
                    <br />
                    
                    Typical dividends range from 1% to 10% annual returns. When the payment is made, it is deposited as cash into your brokerage account, unless you tell your broker to automatically reinvest your dividends by buying more of the stock.<br />
                    
                    <br />
                    
                    It is important to know when a given stock will be issuing dividends for a couple reasons. First, it might be a part of your strategy to try to buy stocks that give back dividends. Second, there is usually higher demand for a stock prior to its ex-dividend date which can cause the price of the stock to increase.</td>

                    One important fundamental is called P/E (price-to-earnings ratio). This ratio shows the relation between a stock&#39;s current price and how much money the business makes.<br />

                    A low P/E can indicate one of two things (or a little of both):<br />
                    
                    <br />

                    ➫ 2. knowledgeable analysts believe the business will be making less money in the near future.<br />
                    
                    <br />
                    
                    When comparing P/E of one stock to another, be sure to compare stocks in the same sector (i.e. tech, finance, pharmaceuticals), or else you&#39;re comparing apples and oranges.<br />

                    When analyzing the news related to a particular business, try to relate everything you read to finances. When non-financial events are reported to keep the public informed on what&#39;s happening within the business organization, you need to determine how that news may effect the finances of the business.<br />
                    
                    <br />
                    
                    The following are some examples of non-financial news that should be analyzed to determine the financial effects it will have on the business.<br />
                    
                    <br />
                    
                    ➫ When changes in leadership occur in the organization, that could indicate higher future earnings (if the replacement is a proven leader) or uncertainty about the future (if the replacement is an unknown).<br />
                    
                    ➫ If there is a lawsuit against the business, or if the business is filing a lawsuit against another organization, that could have an effect on the financial situation of the stock.<br />
                    
                    ➫ If the business has a new product ready to hit the market, it could gain or lose sales based on the success of the new product in comparison with other similar products.<br />
                    
                    ➫ If the business announces the stock is going to split, that could indicate that the business expects continued growth and consistent profit.<br />
                    
                    ➫ If a business is recalling a product, that could decrease demand for the product and cause a decline in future earnings.<br />
                    
                    ➫ If a business has a new product that requires approval before it can hit the market (think drugs that need approval from the FDA or Federal Drug Administration) that could cause significant uncertainty about the financial future of the business until the approval is given or denied.<br />
                    
                    <br />
                    
                    Whenever you read news about a business, try to determine the financial impact of that news. The price of the stock will be driven by the expectation and realization of those financial impacts.</td>

                    If analysts (you&#39;re an analyst too now) feel that a particular stock is going to increase, we say they are feeling bullish. To help remember what bullish means:<br />
                    
                    <br />

                    ➫ the bull is running from left to right towards a rodeo clown<br />

                    If you feel that a stock will decrease in price, you are bearish. To help you remember what bearish means:<br />
                    
                    <br />

                    ➫ the bear has found some unfortunate prey<br />

                    If you think that the current price of a stock is pretty accurate and you don&#39;t expect it to increase or decrease very much, you are neutral, or sideways.<br />
                    
                    <br />

                    You&#39;re likely familiar with movie critics like Siskel and Ebert, and the more modern website Rotten Tomatoes. Stocks receive ratings just like movies do.<br />
