                            <h3>	DEFINITION: a period of time when trading occurs prior to the normal market hours. The pre-market trading session typically occurs between 8:00 - 9:30 A.M. EST each trading day.</h3>

                                Many companies release their earnings reports after the market closes, so investors won&#39;t be able to react immediately. The pre-market trading the following morning is the first opportunity for the market to react.</p>
                                <p>
                                Many investors use the pre-market trading activity to determine how a will stock will perform throughout the day.</p>

                                Trade commissions may be higher during pre-market hours, and the bid-ask spread is usually larger during pre-market hours. Thus, trading during pre-market is a bit more expensive than normal trading hours.</p>
