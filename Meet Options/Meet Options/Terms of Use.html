                            The place where securities are traded is called an exchange. Two of the largest exchanges are the:<br />
                            
                            ➫ NYSE (New York Stock Exchange)<br />
                            
                            ➫ NASDAQ (National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations)<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            Both of these exchanges happen to be based in the USA. The NYSE is an actual place and it is recognized by the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) as an exchange. The NASDAQ is really just a spot in cyberspace and not technically recognized by the SEC as an exchange, but for your trading purposes it works the same way.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            Other notable exchanges are the London Stock Exchange (LSE) and the Tokyo Stock Exchange. In fact, most large countries have their own stock exchange, where different businesses buy and trade their stock.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            At the end of every trading day, many of these exchanges report their total gains and losses. This information helps you to understand the big picture of how trading was for a given day:<br />
                            
                            ➫ busy (high volume) or quiet (low volume)<br />
                            
                            ➫ increasing (bullish) or decreasing (bearish) in value.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            The term &quot;stock market&quot; is often used to describe all the stock exchanges together.</td>

                            You have likely heard of &quot;The Dow&quot; before, which is also known as &quot;The Dow Jones Industrial Average&quot; or &quot;The Dow 30.&quot; You&#39;ve also probably heard someone say, &quot;The Dow was up big today.&quot; What does that mean?<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            The Dow is an index that tracks the value of 30 of the largest businesses in the US. It was named after two of its founders, Charles Dow and Edward Jones.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            The DJIA includes giants like Coca-Cola, 3M, Caterpillar, and ExxonMobil. It doesn&#39;t include some newer big businesses like Apple and Google at the time of this writing.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            The Dow Jones Industrial Average is simply a way to get a feel for the general trends of the stock market. So if someone says &quot;The Dow was up big today,&quot; that simply means that the stock price of those 30 companies increased today. That doesn&#39;t mean that all 30 of them gained value, but as a group their total value increased.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            There are also other indexes that show general market trends.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            The S&amp;P 500, put out by a firm called Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s, is an index that tracks, you guessed it, 500 of the largest businesses in the US (Apple and Google are included there).<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            Russell 2000 is another popular index that tracks the performance of 2000 smaller businesses in the US.</td>

                            Stocks are organized into different categories called &quot;sectors&quot; based on the nature of their business. Examples of sectors include:<br />
                            
                            ➫ technology<br />

                            ➫ finance<br />
                            
                            ➫ retail<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            Sectors are useful to track the overall performance of a certain type of stocks. Sectors also make it easy to compare stocks to look for good trades.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            If you compare the performance of two stocks from different sectors, like an oil company and a computer software company, it&#39;s like comparing apples to oranges because each sector is driven by different external and internal factors.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            However, if you compare businesses from the same sector, like comparing one oil company with another oil company, you can draw accurate conclusions and gain important insight.</td>

                            There are many reasons that businesses sell their stock at the exchange. The most well-known reason is to create capital during the initial public offering (IPO) of the stock by selling part of the ownership of the company through shares of stock.<br />
