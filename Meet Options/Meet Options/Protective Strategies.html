                            A collar is a strategy used to protect long stock positions, and bring in small but consistent profits. To protect your long stock, buy a protective put. At the same time sell a covered call to offset the cost of the put, or even bring in initial credit.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            A protective put let&#39;s you sleep easy at night by limiting your max loss if you own large amounts of stock.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            Theoretically all of your stock could be worthless when you wake up tomorrow, and you would lose all the money you spent to purchase the stock.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            Remember that when the price of a stock drops, the price of the stock&#39;s puts will rise. This inverse relationship is the basis of the protective put strategy. If you buy a put for the stock that you own and the stock begins to drop in value, the put will in turn gain value, negating your loss.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            Think of the protective put like insurance for your stock. Just like car insurance, there is a deductible. If you want a low or no deductible, you will have to pay a lot more for the insurance. In fact, the cost of buying insurance with no deductible is probably so high, that it&#39;s not worth buying since accidents aren&#39;t that common.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            Similarly with protective puts, if you want full protection of your stock it will cost more than it&#39;s worth, so you&#39;re better off having at least a little deductible.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            The deductible with a protective put is the difference between the current value of the stock, and the strike price of the protective put you decide to buy.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            In order to buy protective puts:<br />
                            
                            ➫ Determine how much you are willing to lose on your stock. Consider that your deductible.<br />
                            
                            ➫ Subtract that amount from the current value of the stock, to determine the strike price of the put you should buy.<br />
                            
                            ➫ Buy one out-of-the-money put at that strike price for every 100 shares of the stock that you own.<br />
                            
                            ➫ In the same order with your broker, sell a covered call (as described in the Sideways Strategies tutorial) on the stock that you own.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            If the stock drops enough to make the put that you bought in-the-money, then sell the put for a gain to negate your losses anytime before the put expires. &nbsp;Or you can choose to&nbsp;exercise your put if it becomes in-the-money. Remember that a put is the right to sell 100 shares of the stock at the strike price of the put. So when you exercise your put, your broker will sell your stock at the strike price of the put rather than the current market value of the stock.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            For example, let&#39;s say you own 100 shares of stock XYZ. You paid $100 per share for the stock, and it is currently trading for $100 per share.<br />
                            
                            ➫ Buy a protective put at the $90 strike price for $1 per share.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            If the stock magically drops to $0 tomorrow, you still have the right to sell it for $90 a share. So for the cost of $1 per share, you were able to ensure your stock at $90 a share.</td>
