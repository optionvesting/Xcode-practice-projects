                            <h3>	DEFINITION: a contract that controls the purchase or sale of 100 shares of a given stock. The contract offers the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call) or sell (put) 100 shares of the underlying stock, anytime prior to the option&#39;s expiration date.</h3>
                                <p>
                                The price at which the option lets you buy or sell the stock is called the "strike price." The stock controlled by the option is called the "underlying stock."</p>
                                <p>
                                There are two basic types of options: calls and puts. A call option lets the owner buy 100 shares of the underlying stock, and a put option lets the owner sell 100 shares of the underlying stock.</p>
                                <p>
                                When the price of the underlying stock goes up, the price of the call options goes up and the price of the put options goes down.</p>
                                <p>
                                When the price of the underlying stock goes down, the price of the call options goes down and the price of the put options goes up.</p>
