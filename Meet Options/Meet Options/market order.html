                            <h3>DEFINITION: a type of order where the market maker sets the price, not the investor. The market maker is required to fill all market orders immediately.</h3>
                                <p>
                                The market maker is constantly advertising his current prices. The ask is the price you will pay if you buy a stock or option with a market order. The bid is the price you will get if you sell a stock or option with a market order.</p>
                                <p>
                                To obtain the current bid and ask prices, get a stock quote from one of many available websites.</p>
                                <p>
                                When there is a large bid-ask spread, it is generally better to use a limit order instead of a market order. When there is a small bid-ask spread or you need the order filled immediately, use a market order.</p>
