<h3>DEFINITION: The type of trading that occurs after regular trading hours on an exchange.</h3>
    <p>
    Normal trading hours are between 9:30 am and 4:00 pm EST for exchanges in the USA. After-hours trading takes place both before the market opens and after it closes for normal trading. Pre-market trading from 7:00 am to 9:28 am EST is considered part of "after-hours" trading. After-hours trading also occurs from 4:02 pm to 8:00 pm EST.</p>
    <p>
    After-hours trading volume is high at times based on important economic events, such as earnings reports or pre-earnings announcements that commonly occur outside of normal trading hours. Even though bid-ask spreads are usually larger in after-hours trading than during normal hours, it can still be useful to trade after-hours. Depending on your broker, commission fees may be higher for after-hours orders.</p>
    <p>
    Options cannot generally be traded after-hours.</p>
