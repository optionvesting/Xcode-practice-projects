                                A holder of stock is called a shareholder and has a claim to a part of the corporation&#39;s assets and earnings. This return is usually provided via dividends.</p>
                                <p>
                                Stocks are the foundation of nearly every portfolio. They have outperformed most other investments over the long run.</p>
