                            <h3>	DEFINITION: the value of an option that represents the potential for an option to gain value. Based primarily on the time remaining until the option expires, the extrinsic value continuously decays from the day the option is issued until it expires.</h3>
                                <p>
                                At market close on expiration day, an option will have $0.00 of extrinsic value. That is because the option has no more time left to increase in value.</p>
                                <p>
                                Extrinsic value is often called time value. It is also one of the most important characteristics of options trading. Since extrinsic value slowly erodes away, it is usally a profitable strategy to open short positions on options. Sell the option first to open the short position, and then buy it back at a lesser price after some or all of the extrinsic value has eroded away.</p>
                                <p>
                                To calculate extrinsic (time) value of an option, simply subtract the intrinsic value of the option from the total price of the option.</p>
                                <p>
                                Besides time, other factors can affect extrinsic value. For example, if a stock is expected to have a large change of price in the near future, options issued on that stock will have higher extrinsic value, reflecting the possiblity of the stock&#39;s price to change.</p>
