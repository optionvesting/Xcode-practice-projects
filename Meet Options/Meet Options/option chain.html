                                An option chain can be viewed in two basic forms: stacked and straddle.  The stacked view shows all the call options first, with the put options listed below. A straddle view shows call options on the left and put options on the right.</p>
                                <p>
                                Each option has a bid and ask price that is set by the market maker.</p>
                                <p>
                                Different brokerages and websites show option chains in slightly different formats, but provide similar information.</p>
