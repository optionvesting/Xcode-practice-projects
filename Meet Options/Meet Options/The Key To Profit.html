                            Knowledge is definitely power when it comes to investing. The reason it is so important for investors to include options in their portfolio is because they add so much flexibility. With options in your repertoire, you have the ability to take profits no matter what the stock market is doing.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            Options are the only way to make money when stocks go up, go down, or stay flat. You just need the knowledge to apply the correct strategy.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            Some strategies are low risk and low reward, with a high likelihood of success. Other approaches are high risk and high reward.<br />

                            So you want to make money. Well, technically that&#39;s a goal, but in order to select the best strategy you need to be more specific.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            If your goal is to increase retirement funds, options can help you achieve that. You can trade options in your Roth IRA, and you won&#39;t even have to pay taxes on your gains.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            If you want a little cash flow, options can do that. Just realize that if you consistently take cash out of your trading account it will be much more difficult to make that money grow.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            If you own large amounts of stock and want to protect it, options can do that incredibly well.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            If you want high risk/high reward potential, options can certainly do that also.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            So before you open each option position, you need to have a goal in mind and a solid strategy.</td>

        <h1>Time decay! </h1></p>
        
        <div class="CSSTableGenerator">
            
            <table>
                
                <tbody>
                    
                    <tr>

                            The principle of time decay is the most critical idea to understand in order to have success trading options. This section will teach you what time decay is, and the following section will teach you why it is so essential to use in your strategy.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            Recall that the value of an option is made up of two pieces: intrinsic value and time value.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            Intrinsic value is how much the option is worth right now, and it doesn&#39;t change unless the underlying stock price changes. Time value is how much the option could be worth anytime between now and expiration of the option. Time value is subjective and constantly changes.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            Time value slowly decays from the day the option is first issued to the day it expires. This time value decay exists because each passing day means the option is closer to expiration.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            As the option gets closer to expiration, there is less time for the underlying stock to move and create more intrinsic value.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            For example let&#39;s look at stock X, which is currently trading at $50 a share. Let&#39;s pretend today&#39;s date is November 1st, 2012.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            A call at the $55 strike price is currently out-of-the-money. Remember normal monthly options expire on the 3rd Friday of the month.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            Now let&#39;s look at the price of some different $55 calls:<br />
                            
                            ➫ Dec &#39;12 $55 call: $0.50 (45 days until expiration)<br />
                            
                            ➫ Jan &#39;13 $55 call: $0.80 (75 days until expiration)<br />
                            
                            ➫ Feb &#39;13 $55 call: $1.00 (105 days until expiration)<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            Notice that the options with more time until expiration have more time value built into the price.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            If stock X stays at $50 for the next 30 days until December 1st, the option prices will depreciate to look like this:<br />
                            
                            ➫ Dec &#39;12 $55 call: $0.10 (15 days until expiration)<br />
                            
                            ➫ Jan &#39;13 $55 call: $0.50 (45 days until expiration)<br />
                            
                            ➫ Feb &#39;13 $55 call: $0.80 (75 days until expiration)<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            Notice that the Dec &#39;12 $55 call dropped $0.40 (80% of it&#39;s value) even though the stock didn&#39;t lose value at all. That decrease in time value is called time decay. Time decay is one of the driving factors in options strategies, because you can use it to your advantage with short positions.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            If you had sold that Dec &#39;12 $55 call back on November 1st for $0.50 a share, you could now buy it back one month later for $0.10 a share.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            That&#39;s 80% profit and the stock price didn&#39;t even move!</td>

            <table>

                            Using time decay in your option strategy is comparable to the importance of using interest when talking about basic finances. In general, you want to be the one making interest on your money and you don&#39;t want to be paying the bank interest on your debt. However, there are occasions when it makes a lot of financial sense to take out a loan and have to pay interest in order to take advantage of a money-making possibility, like opening a business or purchasing investment property.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            When you take that loan you need to assess the amount of interest you&#39;ll have to pay, and whether or not it is worth it.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            Similarly, when trading options, you want to be the one selling options short, so that you consistently take profits based on time decay. However, there are times when a money-making possibility presents itself and you should open long option positions. Before opening a long option position, you need to assess the amount of time decay you&#39;re going to have to pay, and it it&#39;s worth it for the possibility of profit.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            Profit is made on short positions when you sell a security and later buy it back at a lower price. Since options continually lose value everyday due to time decay, that means that your odds of making money with short positions on options are very good<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            For example, let&#39;s look at three different scenarios for a generic call option over the period of one week:<br />
                            
                            ➫ Scenario 1 - The price of the underlying stock goes up (the call will gain some intrinsic value and lose some time value)<br />
                            
                            ➫ Scenario 2 - The price of the underlying stock goes down (the call will lose both intrinsic and time value)<br />
                            
                            ➫ Scenario 3 - The underlying stock price stays flat (the call&#39;s intrinsic value won&#39;t change, but it will lose time value)<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            Notice that in all three scenarios the option will lose time value.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            These scenarios show that there&#39;s a greater than 50% chance that the a call will be worth less tomorrow than it is today because of time decay.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            The same principle is true with a put, only in reverse:<br />
                            
                            ➫ Scenario 1 - Stock price goes up, the price of the put goes down a lot (intrinsic value goes down, time value goes down)<br />
                            
                            ➫ Scenario 2 - Stock price goes down, the price of the put goes up a little (intrinsic value goes up, time value goes down a little)<br />
                            
                            ➫ Scenario 3 - Stock price stays flat, the put&#39;s price goes down a little (intrinsic value doesn&#39;t change, time value goes down)<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            There&#39;s still a greater than 50% chance that a put will be worth less tomorrow than it is today.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            Do not forget that your most consistent profit-making strategy with options has to include short positions because of time decay.</td>

                            So if short positions are so great for making money with options, why trade long positions?<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            Well, one reason is that even though you&#39;re more likely to make money with a short position (selling a call or put to start a trade), a long position can make you more money.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            With a long position, your maximum profit is infinite. With a short position you are more likely to profit, but your max profit is finite. Your max profit with a short position is the amount of money you brought in when you sold the option to start the position.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            You can also use long option positions for protection and risk mitigation against short positions. When you combine a long option position and a short option position that is called a spread.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            This is the purpose for trading a spread:<br />
                            
                            ➫ Since you are most likely to profit with a short option position, you sell a call or put to open your trade and take advantage of time decay.<br />
                            
                            ➫ At the same time, also you buy a cheaper call or put option as protection or insurance.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            Here&#39;s an example of why and how to use a spread:<br />
                            
                            ➫ Stock X is at $50, and today is November 1st. You are bullish, and you think Stock X will stay above $45 over the next few weeks.<br />
                            
                            ➫ The $45.00 strike price put is currently out-of-the-money. It costs $1.00 per share (all time value, no intrinsic value).<br />
                            
                            ➫ The $42.50 put is even further out-of-the-money, and thus only costs $0.50 per share (all time value, no intrinsic value).<br />
                            
                            ➫ You decide to open a short position by selling the more expensive $45.00 put for $1.00. That is called selling a naked put. You are very likely to profit selling naked puts, because the put you sold will lose all its time value if:<br />
                            
                            ➫➫ the stock goes up above $50<br />
                            
                            ➫➫ the stock stays flat at $50<br />
                            
                            ➫➫ the stock drops a little (as long as the stock price stays above the $45.00 strike price of the put you sold)<br />
                            
                            ➫ As soon as the put you sold loses all of its time value, you can buy it back for $0 to close the position. That&#39;s an incredible $1 profit per share that you have a greater than 50% chance of getting.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            The only problem with this naked put strategy is you could get hosed if you were wrong to be bullish on the stock, and the price drops below the $45.00 strike price of the put you sold. Once the stock price drops below the strike price of the put you sold, that put now has intrinsic value.<br />
                            
                            ➫ If the stock price drops all the way down to $40, the value of the put would go up to $5 per share. That&#39;s bad since you sold the put short for $1, and now you have to buy it back for $5, so you lose $4 per share.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            You can protect yourself from this high loss by buying the $42.50 put for $0.50 at the same time you sell the $45 put for $1. You get $1 for the $45 put and spend $0.50 on the $42.50 put for a net credit of $0.50.<br />
                            
                            ➫ That reduces your profit from $1 to $0.50, but it also protects you from high loss.<br />
                            
                            ➫ If the stock falls all the way to $40, you still lose money on the put you sold, but you also make money with the put you bought. You still have to buy back the $45 put for $5, but you can now sell the $42.50 put for $2.50, so instead of losing $4 a share you only lose $2.50 a share.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            Thus, a spread decreases your expected profit compared to a naked position, but it limits your possible loss. When you open a credit spread, your broker will keep some money in your account on hold.</td>
