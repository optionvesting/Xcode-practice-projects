                            <h3>	DEFINITION: a loan provided by your broker to purchase securities. When you buy stocks or options with that borrowed money you are "buying on margin." Margin trading can be an important vehicle for profits, but should only be used with low-risk strategies.</h3>
                                <p>
                                In order to receive a margin, you must be approved for margin trading by your broker. Most brokers approve traders for a margin equal to the value of your account, essentially doubling your purchase power.</p>
                                <p>
                                Using a margin is more risky than just trading with your own money. Without a margin, your maximum loss is equal to the value of your account (i.e. the stocks or options you buy could lose all their value). Without a margin, even if all your positions lose all their value, you won&#39;t owe any money to anybody.</p>
                                <p>
                                With a margin, if your positions lose all their value, not only will all of your money be gone, but the broker&#39;s money is gone also. You are required to pay the broker back his money.</p>
                                <p>
                                Whenever you use a margin for your position and you make a profit, you get to keep the entire profit. You only pay a small interest charge on the money borrowed.</p>
