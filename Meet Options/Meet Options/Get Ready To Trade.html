                            All brokers charge a commission on every trade placed; that is the way they make money. Commissions typically vary between stocks and options, with options trades being slightly more expensive.<br />

                            ➫ On the contrary, option trade commissions are usually based on a flat-fee plus a small per-contract fee.<br />
                            
                            ➫ Commissions are also likely higher for orders placed over the phone with a live broker.<br />
                            
                            ➫ If your brokerage provides the ability to trade via a web browser or mobile app, the commissions are likely the same for both of those mediums.<br />

                            In recent years, several discount brokerage websites have been created. These websites include:<br />
                            
                            ➫ optionsXpress<br />

                            Unless you are extremely old-fashioned and completely unable to use a computer (not likely since you are using this material!), you should select a brokerage with a strong online presence. That is because it always cheaper, faster, and downright easier to place trades online. Most brokerages now offer online trading, which is likely to be your primary access method to your account.<br />
                            
                            <br />

                            The ability to place orders and access your account over the phone can be an important feature if you expect to be in places or situations that won&#39;t allow you to have access to the internet. Although that situation is becoming less and less likely everyday, it still exists at the moment, so be sure to check and see if your brokerage offers that capability if you&rsquo;re interested.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            The biggest trend in placing trades is mobile trading (i.e. native and web apps accessible via your smartphone or tablet). Each broker has a different style of mobile capability. Most of their apps can be downloaded from an app store and used in demo mode, even before setting up an account with the brokerage, just to see if you like the interface.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            Know that all brokers aren&#39;t created equally when it comes to placing trades. Some provide more intuitive and streamlined trading platforms to make the process as simple as possible, while others are still rather rudimentary with the online trading platforms.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            Before selecting a new broker, or if you&#39;re planning to switch to a new broker, be sure to set up demo accounts with different brokerages to test out their trading platforms for free.</td>

                            Paper trading provides the perfect platform for trying new strategies and honing your skills. Many brokerages will give you an account of free &ldquo;funny money&rdquo; on the order of $50,000 or $100,000 that you can use however you choose. That way, the first time you do a complex credit spread or a risky play on volatility using naked calls and puts, it&rsquo;s not with real money.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            Paper trading allows you to learn important lessons, with the only cost being the time you put into the trade. Even if you&rsquo;re ready to jump right in and start trading with real money, paper trading allows you go get accustomed to your new broker&rsquo;s trading user-interface which is useful.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            The importance of paper trading can&#39;t be overstated. Although it might not be necessary to practice low risk strategies like selling covered calls, it is highly recommended to try more complex and risky strategies at least once with a paper trading account.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            If you decide to choose a brokerage that doesn&rsquo;t offer paper trading, you can likely find another place online to paper trade, but you won&rsquo;t get to experience how to place trades with your particular broker.</td>

                            As discussed in an earlier module, there are different levels of option trading (usually five, but broker dependent), all of which require approval from your brokerage.<br />

                            The information available in these modules is sufficient for any level of option trading, as long as you are able to thoroughly understand the material, and take advantage of paper trading to practice using different strategies.<br />

                            Cash available is likely to be your biggest limiting factor. Regardless of how much money you have in your account, it doesn&#39;t hurt to request higher levels of option trading approval. Some brokers include credit checks in the approval process, while others factor in how long your account has been open.<br />
                            
                            <br />

                            When you have a question about your account, how to deposit or withdraw money, how to open or close positions, or whatever else, it can be very valuable and comforting to be able to talk to a human being and ask your question. Each brokerage offers a different amount of customer and technical support, available either by phone, email, or live online via chat. Most likely a discount brokerage will offer less live customer support than a more expensive brokerage.</td>
