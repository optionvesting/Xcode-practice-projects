When an investor places a buy-to-open or sell-to-open order, that adds to the open interest of the option. When an investor places a buy-to-close or sell-to-close order, that reduces the open interest of that option.</h3>

                            A common misconception is that open interest is the same thing as volume of options trades. This is not correct though, because the volume is the total number of trades, whether opening or closing, that have been executed for a given option that day.</p>
                            <p>
                            At the start of each trading day, the volume resets to zero. The open interest continues from day to day until all the positions are closed.</p>
                            <p>
                            When open interest is very low, the market maker is able to pay very close attention to every trade that occurs, and often manipulates the bid and ask prices in their favor.</p>
