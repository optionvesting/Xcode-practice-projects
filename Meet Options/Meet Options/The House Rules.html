                            Whenever you place an option trade, you are entering a contract.<br />
                            
                            ➫ A call contract involves buying 100 shares of the underlying stock.<br />

                            Depending on what type of position you want to open (long or short, naked or covered, etc.) your broker may require a certain amount of money in your account, that may be placed on hold until you close the position, in order to ensure you can cover the cost of that contract.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            This amount of money can vary greatly depending on the type of trade.<br />

                            Even though most option strategies don&#39;t involve actually exercising the option to buy or sell any shares of the underlying stock, you are on the hook to fulfill the contract, so your broker needs to make sure that you have enough cash on hand to do so. The money placed on hold is often referred to as a margin requirement.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            The following paragraphs describe how much money (if any) your broker will place on hold for each of the main strategies discussed in these tutorials.</td>

                            When you already own 100 shares of the underlying stock for each contract of the option you want to trade, then your position is referred to as &ldquo;covered.&rdquo; This principle applies if you want to sell a call on the stock, or buy a protective put for the stock.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            With these covered positions, your broker doesn&rsquo;t require any money on hold because the underlying stock is already in your account. In the event that your option contract gets executed, you already have the shares of stock so you won&rsquo;t have to buy them.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            Later tutorials will describe the specific benefits of and steps to open covered positions. Just remember that they are low risk and thus do not require extra money on hold in your account.</td>

                            When you buy a call option, you are buying a contract to be able to buy 100 shares of stock at a given strike price. If you choose to actually use that call option to buy 100 shares of the underlying stock, that is called executing the option.<br />

                            Due to the fact that you bought the option and you decide if/when it will be executed, your broker will not require any extra cash to remain in your account as collateral.<br />

                            When you sell a put option, you are selling a contract to the market maker, that allows him to sell YOU 100 shares of stock at the given strike price. Another way to think of this agreement is that you will buy the stock from the market maker at the strike price.<br />

                            Since the market maker bought the option, it is his choice to execute the option, and he may execute it anytime it is in-the-money before it expires (although this is not common, it could happen). If the market maker chooses to actually use that put option to sell YOU 100 shares of the underlying stock, that is called executing the option.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            It would never make sense for the market maker to execute the option when it is out-of-the-money.<br />

                            Remember, a spread is when you buy one option and sell another on the same underlying stock at the same time. This is a way to limit risk, since it is a way to cover your position.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            Each option that you buy and sell is called a different &quot;leg&quot; of the spread. The option you sell is called the short leg (because it is a short position) and the option you buy is called the long leg (because it is a long position).<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            Typically, if you lose money on one leg of the spread, you will gain money on the other leg, thus lowering risk.<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            As a result, your broker doesn&rsquo;t require as much money on hold for a spread as for selling a naked option. The amount of extra cash required (the margin requirement) is simply the difference between the two strike prices multiplied by the number of shares of stock controlled by the spread (100 for 1 contract, 200 for 2 contracts, etc.).<br />
                            
                            <br />
                            
                            If the short leg of your spread executes, your broker will automatically execute the long leg also, so the entire position closes together, limiting your loss.<br />

In order to &quot;roll&quot; your spread, you simply close the spread that is about to expire and open another spread, with the exact same strike prices, that will expire at a later date.<br />
                            
                            ➫➫ When you roll your spread, you take a small loss, but buy more time for the options to expire out-of-the-money, avoiding your maximum loss.<br />
