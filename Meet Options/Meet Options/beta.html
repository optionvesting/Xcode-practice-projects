<h3>DEFINITION: a measure of the volatility of a stock in relation to the broader market, also known as "beta coefficient".</h3>
<p>
Beta is calculated using regression analysis. The baseline value is 1, which indicates that the stock&#39;s price will move the same amount as the market.</p>
<p>
A beta of less than 1 means that the stock is less volatile than the market.</p>
<p>
A beta of greater than 1 indicates that the stock&#39;s price is more volatile than the market. A stock with a beta of 1.5 moves 50% more than the rest of the market. If the market goes up 1%, that stock should go up about 1.5%. If the market goes down 1%, that stock should go down about 1.5%.</p>
<p>
The time value of options on a stock with a low beta is generally less than that of options on a stock with a high beta.</p>
