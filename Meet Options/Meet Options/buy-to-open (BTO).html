	<h3>DEFINITION: the price at which the market maker will buy a security from you (i.e. the price the market maker is "bid"-ing on the security).</h3>
<p>
Sometimes the bid price is simply referred to as "the bid." The bid price is always less than the ask price.</p>
<p>
If you place a market order to sell a security, you will only get the bid price.</p>
<p>
If you use a limit order to sell a security, you can usually sell the security for slightly more than the bid.</p>
<p>
The bid is the opposite of the ask, which is the price at which the market maker is willing to sell a security.</p>
