                            <h3>	DEFINITION: an abreviation, made up of characters (usually letters) that represent a stock or option. The ticker is listed on an exchange for pricing and trading purposes. All publicly traded businesses have a unique ticker.</h3>
                                Most stocks traded on the NYSE have between 1 and 3 letters in their ticker, like "F" for Ford, "CAT" for Caterpillar. Most stocks traded on the NASDAQ have 4 letters, like "GOOG" for Google.

                                The formatting of option ticker symbols was recently overhauled in 2010. The new format is much longer, but easier to intrepret. The following is an example of an option ticker.</p>
                                <p dir="ltr">
                                YHOO100416C00020000</p>
                                <p dir="ltr">
                                The first letters (YHOO) are the ticker of the underlying stock. The following 6 letters (13/05/17) are the year/month/day of expiration, respectively. The next letter (C) indicates call or put. The remaining digits (00020000) indicate the strike price of $20.00.</p>
                                <p dir="ltr">
                                When placing stock orders, you simply type in the stock&#39;s ticker to create the order. Since option tickers are so long, most brokerage websites allow you to simply select the option(s) you want to trade from an option chain with a simple click.</p>
