                                For example, you buy a stock for $50. You don&#39;t want to lose more than 10%, so you set your trailing stop order at 10%. As the stock price climbs to $60, your trailing stop order follows it up, remainig 10% lower than the stock price ($54). Then if the stock drops back below $54, you trailing stop order will fill.</p>
