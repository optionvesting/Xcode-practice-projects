                            <p>
                            Because it trades like a stock, an ETF does not have its net asset value (NAV) calculated every day like a mutual fund does. </p>
                            <p>
                            An ETF is similar to a mutual fund, in that its price is based on a variety of stocks. However, it is different from a mutual fund because it has little to no fees.</p>
                            <p>
                            One commonly traded ETF is called the Spider (SPDR), and tracks the SP 500 index. The ticker symbol for SPDR is SPY.</p>
                            <p>
                            When the value of the SP increases, the value of the SPDR will also increase.</p>
